Parliamentary votes, preclassified by an expert (on a chosen subset), are verified at an assumed significance level by seeking the most likely match with the actual vote results.

This paper introduces and analyzes the convergence properties of a method that computes an approximation to the invariant subspace associated with a group of eigenvalues of a large not necessarily diagonalizable matrix. The method belongs to the family of projection type methods. At each step, it refines the approximate invariant subspace using a linearized Riccati's equation which turns out to be the block analogue of the correction used in the Jacobi-Davidson method. The analysis conducted in this paper shows that the method converges at a rate quasi-quadratic provided that the approximate invariant subspace is close to the exact one. The implementation of the method based on multigrid techniques is also discussed and numerical experiments are reported", "1472": "Surface textures improve the robustness of stereoscopic depth cues. This research develops design recommendations for surface textures (patterns of color on object surfaces) rendered with stereoscopic displays. In 3 method-of-adjustment procedure experiments, 8 participants matched the disparity of a circular probe and a planar stimulus rendered using a single visible edge. The experiments varied stimulus orientation and surface texture. Participants more accurately matched the depth of vertical stimuli than that of horizontal stimuli, consistent with previous studies and existing theory. Participants matched the depth of surfaces with large pixel-to-pixel luminance variations more accurately than they did surfaces with a small pixel-to-pixel luminance variation. Finally, they matched the depth of surfaces with vertical line patterns more accurately than they did surfaces with horizontal-striped texture patterns. These results suggest that designers can enhance depth perception in stereoscopic displays, and also reduce undesirable sensitivity to orientation, by rendering objects with surface textures using large pixel-to-pixel luminance variations", "1761": "Superconvergence of discontinuous Galerkin method for nonstationary hyperbolic equation.

We carried out a pilot study comparing satisfaction levels between psychiatric patients seen face to face (FTF) and those seen via videoconference. Patients who consented were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received services in person (FTF from the visiting psychiatrist) while the other was seen using videoconferencing at 128 kbit/s. One psychiatrist provided all the FTF and videoconferencing assessment and follow-up visits. A total of 24 subjects were recruited. Three of the subjects (13%) did not attend their appointments and two subjects in each group were lost to follow-up. Thus there were nine in the FTF group and eight in the videoconferencing group. The two groups were similar in most respects. Patient satisfaction with the services was assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), completed four months after the initial consultation. The mean scores were 25.3 in the FTF group and 21.6 in the videoconferencing group. Although there was a trend in favour of the FTF service, the difference was not significant. Patient satisfaction is only one component of evaluation. The efficacy of telepsychiatry must also be measured relative to that of conventional, FTF care before policy makers can decide how extensively telepsychiatry should be implemented", "1870": "Robust control of nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainty. Probabilistic robustness analysis and synthesis for nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters are presented. Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the likelihood of system instability and violation of performance requirements subject to variations of the probabilistic system parameters. Stochastic robust control synthesis searches the controller design parameter space to minimize a cost that is a function of the probabilities that design criteria will not be satisfied.

The IS/IT function has recently emerged from the peripheral aspects of the finance department to the centre of critical organisational change. There is an increasing dependency on its activities as systems extend beyond supporting the internal efficiency of the organisation to augmenting global performance. The growth of wide and local networks has resulted in communication possibilities that were not possible a few years ago. E-commerce challenges the achievements of the IS/IT function and is very prominent in the globalisation of modern organisations. The complexity and diversity of electronic exchange is also well documented (Hackney et al., 2000). This has a number of impacts on the development and implementation of IS/IT solutions for organisations involved in international trade. It is a conjecture that the IS/IT function is critically important for the alignment of the business to meet the demands of global competition, through building internal marketing strategies and creating knowledge based communities. There is clear evidence that IS/IT can lead to improved business performance and potentially for sustained competitive advantage.

In this paper, we analyze how sharing advance demand information (ADI) can improve supply-chain performance. We consider two types of ADI, aggregated ADI (A-ADI) and detailed ADI (D-ADI). With A-ADI, customers share with manufacturers information about whether they will place an order for some product in the next time period, but do not share information about which product they will order and which of several potential manufacturers will receive the order. With D-ADI, customers additionally share information about which product they will order, but which manufacturer will receive the order remains uncertain. We develop and solve mathematical models of supply chains where ADI is shared. We derive exact expressions and closed-form approximations for expected costs, expected base-stock levels, and variations of the production quantities. We show that both the manufacturer and the customers benefit from sharing ADI, but that sharing ADI increases the bullwhip effect. We also show that under certain conditions it is optimal to collect ADI from either none or all of the customers. We study two supply chains in detail: a supply chain with an arbitrary number of products that have identical demand rates, and a supply chain with two products that have arbitrary demand rates. For these two supply chains, we analyze how the values of A-ADI and D-ADI depend on the characteristics of the supply chain and on the quality of the shared information, and we identify conditions under which sharing A-ADI and D-ADI can significantly reduce cost. Our results can be used by decision makers to analyze the cost savings that can be achieved by sharing ADI and help them to determine if sharing ADI is beneficial for their supply chains", "182": "Phase transition for parking blocks, Brownian excursion and coalescence. In this paper, we consider hashing with linear probing for a hashing table with m places, n items (n<m), and l=m-n empty places. For a noncomputer science-minded reader, we shall use the metaphore of n cars parking on m places: each car c/sub i/ chooses a place p/sub i/ at random, and if p/sub i/ is occupied, c/sub i/ tries successively p/sub i/+1, p/sub i/+2, until it finds an empty place. Pittel [42] proves that when l/m goes to some positive limit beta <1, the size B/sub 1//sup m,l/ of the largest block of consecutive cars satisfies 2( beta -1-log beta ) B/sub 1//sup m,l/=2 log m-3 log log m+ Xi /sub m/, where Xi /sub m/ converges weakly to an extreme-value distribution. In this paper we examine at which level for n a phase transition occurs between B/sub 1//sup m,l/=o(m) and m-B/sub 1//sup m,l/=o(m).

Researchers who make theoretical advances also need some way to demonstrate that an advance really does have general, overall positive consequences for system performance. For this it is necessary to evaluate the system on a set of problems that is sufficiently large and diverse to be somehow representative of the intended application area as a whole. It is only a small step from system evaluation to a communal system competition. The CADE ATP System Competition (CASC) has been run annually since 1996. Any competition is difficult to design and organize in the first instance, and to then run over the years. In order to obtain the full benefits of a competition, a thoroughly organized event, with an unambiguous and motivated design, is necessary. For some issues relevant to the CASC design, inevitable constraints have emerged. For other issues there have been several choices, and decisions have had to be made.

The simulation and experimental study of a fuzzy logic controlled, three-phase shunt active power filter to improve power quality by compensating harmonics and reactive power required by a nonlinear load is presented. The advantage of fuzzy control is that it is based on a linguistic description and does not require a mathematical model of the system. The fuzzy control scheme is realised on an inexpensive dedicated micro-controller (INTEL 8031) based system. The compensation process is based on sensing line currents only, an approach different from conventional methods, which require harmonics or reactive volt-ampere requirement of the load. The performance of the fuzzy logic controller is compared with a conventional PI controller. The dynamic behavior of the fuzzy controller is found to be better than the conventional PI controller.

It is shown how a circle-criterion approach can be used to design an observer-based state feedback control which yields a closed-loop system with specified robustness characteristics. The approach is relevant for design with preservation of stability when a cone-bounded nonlinearity is introduced in the feedback loop.

In the wake of the computer and information technology revolutions, vehicles are undergoing dramatic changes in their capabilities and how they interact with drivers. Although some vehicles can decide to either generate warnings for the human driver or control the vehicle autonomously, they must usually make these decisions in real time with only incomplete information. So, human drivers must still maintain control over the vehicle. I sketch a digital driving behavior model. By simulating and analyzing driver behavior during different maneuvers such as lane changing, lane following, and traffic avoidance, researchers participating in the Beijing Institute of Technology's digital-driving project will be able to examine the possible correlations or causal relations between the smart vehicle, IVISs, the intelligent road-traffic-information network, and the driver.

This paper applies the two-party dependence theory (Castelfranchi, Cesta and Miceli, 1992, in Y. Demazeau and E. Werner (Eds.) Decentralized AI-3, Elsevier, North Holland) to modelling multiagent and group dependence. These have theoretical potentialities for the study of emerging groups and collective structures, and more generally for understanding social and organisational complexity, and practical utility for both social-organisational and agent systems purposes. In the paper, the dependence theory is extended to describe multiagent links, with a special reference to group and collective phenomena, and is proposed as a framework for the study of emerging social structures, such as groups and collectives. In order to do so, we propose to extend the notion of dependence networks (applied to a single agent) to dependence graphs (applied to an agency). In its present version, the dependence theory is argued to provide (a) a theoretical instrument for the study of social complexity, and (b) a computational system for managing the negotiation process in competitive contexts and for monitoring complexity in organisational and other cooperative contexts", "1603": "Exploiting structure in adaptive dynamic programming algorithms for a stochastic batch service problem. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the importance of using structural results in dynamic programming algorithms. We consider the problem of approximating optimal strategies for the batch service of customers at a service station. Customers stochastically arrive at the station and wait to be served, incurring a waiting cost and a service cost. Service of customers is performed in groups of a fixed service capacity. We investigate the structure of cost functions and establish some theoretical results including monotonicity of the value functions. Then, we use our adaptive dynamic programming monotone algorithm that uses structure to preserve monotonicity of the estimates at each iterations to approximate the value functions. Since the problem with homogeneous customers can be solved optimally, we have a means of comparison to evaluate our heuristic. Finally, we compare our algorithm to classical forward dynamic programming methods", "1530": "Uniform supersaturated design and its construction.

Taking into account both the limitation due to the chosen application field and the preliminary autocalibration phase automatically carried out by the proposed device, accuracy and reliability on the order of 1% is estimated. The previously indicated value has to be considered satisfactory in light of the field of application and the small values of the simulated parameters. Finally, the achieved metrological characteristics allow the described neonatal simulator to be adopted as a reference device to test performances of neonatal ventilators and, more specifically, to measure the time elapsed between the occurrence of a potentially dangerous condition to the patient and the activation of the corresponding alarm of the tested ventilator", "1631": "Recovering lost efficiency of exponentiation algorithms on smart cards.

Each job will incur an early (tardy) penalty if it is early (tardy) with respect to the common due window under a given schedule. The window size is a given parameter but the window location is a decision variable. The objective of the problem is to find a schedule that minimizes the weighted number of early and tardy jobs and the location penalty. We show that the problem is NP-complete in the ordinary sense and develop a dynamic programming based pseudo-polynomial algorithm.

Product-mix flexibility is one of the major types of manufacturing flexibility, referring to the ability to produce a broad range of products or variants with presumed low changeover costs. The value of such a capability is important to establish for an industrial firm in order to ensure that the flexibility provided will be at the right level and used profitably rather than in excess of market requirements and consequently costly. We use option-pricing theory to analyse the impact of various product-mix issues on the value of flexibility. The real options model we use incorporates multiple products, capacity constraints as well as set-up costs. The issues treated here include the number of products, demand variability, correlation between products, and the relative demand distribution within the product mix. Thus, we are interested in the nature of the input data to analyse its effect on the value of flexibility. We also check the impact at different capacity levels. The results suggest that the value of flexibility (i) increases with an increasing number of products, (ii) decreases with increasing volatility of product demand, (iii) decreases the more positively correlated the demand is, and (iv) reduces for marginal capacity with increasing levels of capacity. Of these, the impact of positively correlated demand seems to be a major issue.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) attempts to identify unauthorized use, misuse, and abuse of computer and network systems. As intrusions become more sophisticated, dealing with them moves beyond the scope of one IDS. The need arises for systems to cooperate with one another, to manage diverse attacks across networks. The feature of recent attacks is that the packet delivery is moderately slow, and the attack sources and attack targets are distributed. These attacks are called \"stealthy attacks.\" To detect these attacks, the deployment of distributed IDSs is needed. In such an environment, the ability of an IDS to share advanced information about these attacks is especially important. In this research, the IDS model exploits blacklist facts to detect the attacks that are based on either slow or highly distributed packets. To maintain the valid blacklist facts in the knowledge base of each IDS, the model should communicate with the other IDSs. When attack level goes beyond the interaction threshold, ID agents send interaction messages to ID agents in other hosts.

This paper reports on the clinical application of a system for recovering the time-varying three-dimensional (3-D) left-ventricular (LV) shape from multiview X-ray cineangiocardiograms. Considering that X-ray cineangiocardiography is still commonly employed in clinical cardiology and computational costs for 3-D recovery and visualization are rapidly decreasing, it is meaningful to develop a clinically applicable system for 3-D LV shape recovery from X-ray cineangiocardiograms. The system is based on a previously reported closed-surface method of shape recovery from two-dimensional occluding contours with multiple views. To apply the method to \"real\" LV cineangiocardiograms, user-interactive systems were implemented for preprocessing, including detection of LV contours, calibration of the imaging geometry, and setting of the LV model coordinate system. The results for three real LV angiographic image sequences are presented, two with fixed multiple views (using supplementary angiography) and one with rotating views. 3-D reconstructions utilizing different numbers of views were compared and evaluated in terms of contours manually traced by an experienced radiologist. The performance of the preprocesses was also evaluated, and the effects of variations in user-specified parameters on the final 3-D reconstruction results were shown to be sufficiently small.

The proposed circulant preconditioners can be constructed without requiring explicit knowledge of the generating functions. It was shown that the spectra of the preconditioned matrices are uniformly bounded except for a fixed number of outliers and that all eigenvalues are uniformly bounded away from zero. Therefore the conjugate gradient method converges linearly when applied to solving the circulant preconditioned systems.

Two models for determining an optimised flight route are described, the first employing integer programming and the second, genetic algorithms. A comparison of the solution optimality in terms of the total distance travelled, and model efficiency of the two techniques in terms of their required CPU times, is made in order to identify the conditions under which it is appropriate to apply each model", "1789": "Dousing terrorist funding: mission possible?

Issues of career movement and change are examined between library and archival fields and from small colleges to large universities. Issues examined include professional education and training, initial career-planning and placement, continuing education, scouting and mentoring, job market conditions, work experience and personal skills, professional involvement, and professional association self-interest. This examination leads to five observations: 1. It is easier, in terms of career transitions, for a librarian to become an archivist than it is for an archivist to become a librarian; 2. The progression from a small college venue to a large research university is very manageable with the proper planning and experience; 3. At least three of the career elements-professional education, career-planning, and professional association self-interest-in their best moments provide a foundation that enables a future consideration of change between institutional types and professional areas and in their worst moments conspire against the midcareer professional in terms of change; 4. The elements of scouting, continuing education, work experience, and professional involvement offer the greatest assistance in career transitions; 5.

Given a Bezier curve of degree n, the problem of optimal multi-degree reduction (degree reduction of more than one degree) by a Bezier curve of degree m (m<n-1) with constraints of endpoint continuity is investigated. With respect to L/sub 2/ norm, this paper presents an approximate method (MDR by L/sub 2/) that gives an explicit solution to deal with it. The method has good properties of endpoint interpolation: continuity of any r, s (r, s>or=0) orders can be preserved at two endpoints respectively. The method in the paper performs multi-degree reduction at one time and does not need stepwise computing. When applied to multi-degree reduction with endpoint continuity of any order, the MDR by L/sub 2/ obtains the best least squares approximation. Comparison with another method of multi-degree reduction (MDR by L/sub infinity /), which achieves the nearly best uniform approximation with respect to L/sub infinity / norm, is also given. The approximate effect of the MDR by L/sub 2/ is better than that of the MDR by L/sub infinity /. Explicit approximate error analysis of the multi-degree reduction methods is presented", "1491": "Evaluation of videoconferenced grand rounds. We evaluated various aspects of grand rounds videoconferenced from a tertiary care hospital to a regional hospital in Nova Scotia. During a five-month study period, 29 rounds were broadcast (19 in medicine and 10 in cardiology). The total recorded attendance at the remote site was 103, comprising 70 specialists, nine family physicians and 24 other health-care professionals. We received 55 evaluations, a response rate of 53%. On a five-point Likert scale (on which higher scores indicated better quality), mean ratings by remote-site participants of the technical quality of the videoconference were 3.0-3.5, with the lowest ratings being for ability to hear the discussion (3.0) and to see visual aids (3.1). Mean ratings for content, presentation, discussion and educational value were 3.8 or higher. Of the 49 physicians who presented the rounds, we received evaluations from 41, a response rate of 84%. The presenters rated all aspects of the videoconference and interaction with remote sites at 3.8 or lower. The lowest ratings were for ability to see the remote sites (3.0) and the usefulness of the discussion (3.4). We received 278 evaluations from participants at the presenting site, an estimated response rate of about 55%. The results indicated no adverse opinions of the effect of videoconferencing (mean scores 3.1-3.3). The estimated costs of videoconferencing one grand round to one site and four sites were C$723 and C$1515, respectively. The study confirmed that videoconferenced rounds can provide satisfactory continuing medical education to community specialists, which is an especially important consideration as maintenance of certification becomes mandatory", "1692": "Passing the image test [imaging accreditation].

In this paper, PRIMES (Progressive Reasoning and Intelligent multiple MEthods System), a new architecture for resource-bounded reasoning that combines a form of progressive reasoning and the so-called multiple methods approach is presented. Each time-critical reasoning unit is designed in such a way that it delivers an approximate result in time whenever an overload or a failure prevents the system from producing the most accurate result. Indeed, reasoning units use approximate processing based on two salient features. First, an incremental processing unit constructs an approximate solution quickly and then refines it incrementally. Second, a multiple methods approach proposes different alternatives to solve the problem, each of them being selected according to the available resources. In allowing several resource-bounded reasoning paradigms to be combined, we hope to extend their actual scope to cover more real-world application domains", "1853": "CherylAnn Silberer: all about process [accounting technologist].

In a given project network, execution of each activity in normal duration requires utilization of certain resources. If faster execution of an activity is desired then additional resources at extra cost would be required. Given a project network, the cost structure for each activity and a planning horizon, the project compression problem is concerned with the determination of optimal schedule of performing each activity while satisfying given restrictions and minimizing the total cost of project execution. The paper considers the project compression problem with time dependent cost structure for each activity. The planning horizon is divided into several regular time intervals over which the cost structure of an activity may vary. But the cost structure of the activities remains the same within a time interval. The objective is to find an optimal project schedule minimizing the total project cost.

The art (and science) of successful product/service positioning generally hinges on the firm's ability to select a set of attractively priced consumer benefits that are: valued by the buyer, distinctive in one or more respects, believable, deliverable, and sustainable (under actual or potential competitive abilities to imitate, neutralize, or overcome) in the target markets that the firm selects. For many years, the ubiquitous quadrant chart has been used to provide a simple graph of product/service benefits (usually called product/service attributes) described in terms of consumers' perceptions of the importance of attributes (to brand/supplier choice) and the performance of competing firms on these attributes. This paper describes a model that extends the quadrant chart concept to a decision support system that optimizes a firm's market share for a specified product/service. In particular, we describe a decision support model that utilizes relatively simple marketing research data on consumers' judged benefit importances, and supplier performances on these benefits to develop message components for specified target buyers. A case study is used to illustrate the model. The study deals with developing advertising message components for a relatively new entrant in the US air shipping market.

A concept less restrictive than STLC, termed the small-time local output controllability (STLOC) is introduced, the satisfaction of which guarantees that a chosen configuration output can be controlled at its desired value.

Also, a simple blending method of patchwork is proposed to construct C/sup n-1/ surfaces, where overlapping control nets are utilized. It takes into account the semi-localness property of universal parametrization. It effectively helps us construct very natural looking B-spline surfaces while keeping the deviation from given data points very low.

The explosive growth in air traffic as well as the widespread adoption of Operations Research techniques in airline scheduling has given rise to tight flight schedules at major airports. An undesirable consequence of this is that a minor incident such as a delay in the arrival of a small number of flights can result in a chain reaction of events involving several flights and airports, causing disruption throughout the system. This paper reviews recent literature in the area of recovery from schedule disruptions. First we review how disturbances at a given airport could be handled, including the effects of runways and fixes. Then we study the papers on recovery from airline schedule perturbations, which involve adjustments in flight schedules, aircraft, and crew. The mathematical programming techniques used in ground holding are covered in some detail. We conclude the review with suggestions on how singular perturbation theory could play a role in analyzing disruptions to such highly sensitive schedules as those in the civil aviation industry", "1757": "Even unimodular Gaussian lattices of rank 12.

Data envelopment analysis (DEA) measures the relative efficiency of decision making units (DMUs) with multiple performance factors which are grouped into outputs and inputs. Once the efficient frontier is determined, inefficient DMUs can improve their performance to reach the efficient frontier by either increasing their current output levels or decreasing their current input levels. However, both desirable (good) and undesirable (bad) factors may be present. For example, if inefficiency exists in production processes where final products are manufactured with a production of wastes and pollutants, the outputs of wastes and pollutants are undesirable and should be reduced to improve the performance. Using the classification invariance property, we show that the standard DEA model can be used to improve the performance via increasing the desirable outputs and decreasing the undesirable outputs. The method can also be applied to situations when some inputs need to be increased to improve the performance.

Additionally, pilots were tested on their awareness of speed, altitude, and heading during the flight. Results indicated that the presence of a flight guidance cue significantly improved flight path awareness while intercepting the pathway, but significant practice effects suggest that a guidance cue might be unnecessary if pilots are given proper training. The amount of time spent looking outside the cockpit while using the HITS display was significantly less than when using conventional aircraft instruments.

II. Laminate theory and applications. For pt. I see ibid., pp. 1159-76. The two papers report systematically a constitutive description for the inelastic and strength behavior of laminated composites reinforced with various fiber preforms. The constitutive relationship is established micromechanically, through layer-by-layer analysis. Namely, only the properties of the constituent fiber and matrix materials of the composites are required as input data. In the previous part lamina theory was presented. Three fundamental quantities of the laminae, i.e. the internal stresses generated in the constituent fiber and matrix materials and the instantaneous compliance matrix, with different fiber preform (including woven, braided, and knitted fabric) reinforcements were explicitly obtained by virtue of the bridging micromechanics model. In this paper, the laminate stress analysis is shown. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the load shared by each lamina in the laminate, so that the lamina theory can be applied. Incorporation of the constitutive equations into an FEM software package is illustrated. A number of application examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the constitutive theory. The predictions made include: failure envelopes of multidirectional laminates subjected to biaxial in-plane loads, thermomechanical cycling stress-strain curves of a titanium metal matrix composite laminate, S-N curves of multilayer knitted fabric reinforced laminates under tensile fatigue, and bending load-deflection plots and ultimate bending strengths of laminated braided fabric reinforced beams subjected to lateral loads", "1791": "The pedagogy of on-line learning: a report from the University of the Highlands and Islands Millennium Institute.

For the case of isotropic diffusion we consider the representation of the weighted concentration of trajectories and its space derivatives in the form of integrals (with some weights) of the solution to the corresponding boundary value problem and its directional derivative of a convective velocity. If the convective velocity at the domain boundary is degenerate and some other additional conditions are imposed this representation allows us to construct an efficient 'random walk by spheres and balls' algorithm. When these conditions are violated, transition to modelling the diffusion trajectories by the Euler scheme is realized, and the directional derivative of velocity is estimated by the dependent testing method, using the parallel modelling of two closely-spaced diffusion trajectories. We succeeded in justifying this method by statistically equivalent transition to modelling a single trajectory after the first step in the Euler scheme, using a suitable weight. This weight also admits direct differentiation with respect to the initial coordinate along a given direction. The resulting weight algorithm for calculating concentration derivatives is especially efficient if the initial point is in the subdomain in which the coefficients of the diffusion equation are constant", "191": "Linear, parameter-varying control and its application to a turbofan engine. This paper describes application of parameter-dependent control design methods to a turbofan engine. Parameter-dependent systems are linear systems, whose state-space descriptions are known functions of time-varying parameters. The time variation of each of the parameters is not known in advance, but is assumed to be measurable in real-time. Three linear, parameter-varying (LPV) approaches to control design are discussed. The first method is based on linear fractional transformations which relies on the small gain theorem for bounds on performance and robustness. The other methods make use of either a single (SQLF) or parameter-dependent (PDQLF) quadratic Lyapunov function to bound the achievable level of performance. The latter two techniques are used to synthesize controllers for a high-performance turbofan engine. A LPV model of the turbofan engine is constructed from Jacobian linearizations at fixed power codes for control design. The control problem is formulated as a model matching problem in the H/sub infinity / and LPV framework. The objective is decoupled command response of the closed-loop system to pressure and rotor speed requests. The performance of linear, H/sub infinity / point designs are compared with the SQLF and PDQLF controllers. Nonlinear simulations indicate that the controller synthesized using the SQLF approach is slightly more conservative than the PDQLF controller. Nonlinear simulations with the SQLF and PDQLF controllers show very robust designs that achieve all desired performance objectives", "1829": "Improved approximation of Max-Cut on graphs of bounded degree.

EID has been applied to industry-scale problems in a broad variety of application domains (e.g., process control, aviation, computer network management, software engineering, medicine, command and control, and information retrieval) and has consistently led to the identification of new information requirements. An experimental evaluation of EID using a full-fidelity simulator with professional workers has yet to be conducted, although some are planned. Several significant challenges remain as obstacles to the confident use of EID in industry. Promising paths for addressing these outstanding issues are identified.

The first-order theorem prover SCOTT has been through a series of versions over some ten years. The successive provers, while retaining the same underlying technology, have used radically different algorithms and shown wide differences of behaviour. The development process has depended heavily on experiments with problems from the TPTP library and has been sharpened by participation in CASC each year since 1997. We outline some of the difficulties inherent in designing and refining a theorem prover as complex as SCOTT, and explain our experimental methodology. While SCOTT is not one of the systems which have been highly optimised for CASC, it does help to illustrate the influence of both CASC and the TPTP library on contemporary theorem proving research", "1666": "Airline base schedule optimisation by flight network annealing. A system for rigorous airline base schedule optimisation is described. The architecture of the system reflects the underlying problem structure.

The sub-problem is made up of a number of component sub-problems including connection generation, passenger choice modelling, passenger traffic allocation by simulation and revenue and cost determination. Schedule optimisation is carried out by means of simulated annealing of flight networks. The operators for the simulated annealing process are feasibility preserving and form a complete set of operators", "1607": "A solvable queueing network model for railway networks and its validation and applications for the Netherlands. The performance of new railway networks cannot be measured or simulated, as no detailed train schedules are available. Railway infrastructure and capacities are to be determined long before the actual traffic is known. This paper therefore proposes a solvable queueing network model to compute performance measures of interest without requiring train schedules (timetables). Closed form expressions for mean delays are obtained. New network designs, traffic scenarios, and capacity expansions can so be evaluated. A comparison with real delay data for the Netherlands supports the practical value of the model. A special Dutch cargo-line application is included", "1885": "Analysis of nonlinear time-delay systems using modules over non-commutative rings. The theory of non-commutative rings is introduced to provide a basis for the study of nonlinear control systems with time delays. The left Ore ring of non-commutative polynomials defined over the field of a meromorphic function is suggested as the framework for such a study. This approach is then generalized to a broader class of nonlinear systems with delays that are called generalized Roesser systems. Finally, the theory is applied to analyze nonlinear time-delay systems. A weak observability is defined and characterized, generalizing the well-known linear result. Properties of closed submodules are then developed to obtain a result on the accessibility of such systems", "1751": "An adaptive time step procedure for a parabolic problem with blow-up. In this paper we introduce and analyze a fully discrete approximation for a parabolic problem with a nonlinear boundary condition which implies that the solutions blow up in finite time. We use standard linear elements with mass lumping for the space variable. For the time discretization we write the problem in an equivalent form which is obtained by introducing an appropriate time re-scaling and then, we use explicit Runge-Kutta methods for this equivalent problem. In order to motivate our procedure we present it first in the case of a simple ordinary differential equation and show how the blow up time is approximated in this case. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the blowup of the numerical solution and prove that the numerical blow-up time converges to the continuous one. We also study, for the explicit Euler approximation, the localization of blow-up points for the numerical scheme", "1608": "A geometric process equivalent model for a multistate degenerative system. In this paper, a monotone process model for a one-component degenerative system with k+1 states (k failure states and one working state) is studied.

Furthermore, an explicit expression for the determination of an optimal policy is derived", "1462": "Non-linear analysis of nearly saturated porous media: theoretical and numerical formulation. A formulation for a porous medium saturated with a compressible fluid undergoing large elastic and plastic deformations is presented. A consistent thermodynamic formulation is proposed for the two-phase mixture problem; thus preserving a straightforward and robust numerical scheme. A novel feature is the specification of the fluid compressibility in terms of a volumetric logarithmic strain, which is energy conjugated to the fluid pressure in the entropy inequality. As a result, the entropy inequality is used to separate three different mechanisms representing the response: effective stress response according to Terzaghi in the solid skeleton, fluid pressure response to compressibility of the fluid, and dissipative Darcy flow representing the interaction between the two phases. The paper is concluded with a couple of numerical examples that display the predictive capabilities of the proposed formulation. In particular, we consider results for the kinematically linear theory as compared to the kinematically non-linear theory", "1466": "Feldkamp-type image reconstruction from equiangular data. The cone-beam approach for image reconstruction attracts increasing attention in various applications, especially medical imaging. Previously, the traditional practical cone-beam reconstruction method, the Feldkamp algorithm, was generalized into the case of spiral/helical scanning loci with equispatial cone-beam projection data. In this paper, we formulated the generalized Feldkamp algorithm in the case of equiangular cone-beam projection data, and performed numerical simulation to evaluate the image quality. Because medical multi-slice/cone-beam CT scanners typically use equiangular projection data, our new formula may be useful in this area as a framework for further refinement and a benchmark for comparison", "1774": "A work journal [librarianship].

The syntenic distance between two genomes is given by the minimum number of fusions, fissions, and translocations required to transform one into the other, ignoring the order of genes within chromosomes. Computing this distance is NP-hard. In the present work, we give a tight connection between syntenic distance and the incomplete gossip problem, a novel generalization of the classical gossip problem. In this problem, there are n gossipers, each with a unique piece of initial information; they communicate by phone calls in which the two participants exchange all their information. The goal is to minimize the total number of phone calls necessary to inform each gossiper of his set of relevant gossip which he desires to learn. As an application of the connection between syntenic distance and incomplete gossip, we derive an O(2/sup O(n log n)/) algorithm to exactly compute the syntenic distance between two genomes with at most n chromosomes each. Our algorithm requires O(n/sup 2/+2/sup O(d log d)/) time when this distance is d, improving the O(n/sup 2/+2(O(d//sup 2/))) running time of the best previous exact algorithm", "1492": "A systematic review of the efficacy of telemedicine for making diagnostic and management decisions. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine for making diagnostic and management decisions in three classes of application: office/hospital-based, store-and-forward, and home-based telemedicine. We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and HealthSTAR databases and printed resources, and interviewed investigators in the field. We excluded studies where the service did not historically require face-to-face encounters (e.g. radiology or pathology diagnosis). A total of 58 articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles were summarized and graded for the quality and direction of the evidence. There were very few high-quality studies. The strongest evidence for the efficacy of telemedicine for diagnostic and management decisions came from the specialties of psychiatry and dermatology. There was also reasonable evidence that general medical history and physical examinations performed via telemedicine had relatively good sensitivity and specificity. Other specialties in which some evidence for efficacy existed were cardiology and certain areas of ophthalmology. Despite the widespread use of telemedicine in most major medical specialties, there is strong evidence in only a few of them that the diagnostic and management decisions provided by telemedicine are comparable to face-to-face care", "1866": "Tracking with sensor failures.

Based on the concept of VR decomposition, the problem of management of such systems is discussed. As a sub-type that makes mMAS closer to the application sphere, an evolutionary multi-agent system (EMAS) is proposed.

This paper presents a new method of knowledge gathering for decision support in image understanding based on information extracted from the dynamics of saccadic eye movements.

The dynamics of the visual search are analyzed by using the Markov model for providing training information to novices on how and where to look for image features. The validity of the framework has been evaluated in a clinical scenario whereby the pulmonary vascular distribution on Computed Tomography images was assessed by experienced radiologists as a potential indicator of heart failure. The performance of the system has been demonstrated by training four novices to follow the visual assessment behavior of two experienced observers.

A combined discrete/continuous simulation methodology based on the DEVS (discrete event system specification) formalism is presented in this paper that satisfies the simulation requirements of 3-dimensional and dynamic systems with multi-components. We propose a geometric and kinematic DEVS (GK-DEVS) formalism that is able to describe the geometric and kinematic structure of a system and its continuous state dynamics as well as the interaction among the multi-components. To establish one model having dynamic behavior and a particular hierarchical structure, the atomic and the coupled model of the conventional DEVS are merged into one model in the proposed formalism. For simulation of the continuous motion of 3-D components, the sequential state set is partitioned into the discrete and the continuous state set and the rate of change function over the continuous state set is employed. Although modified from the conventional DEVS formalism, the GK-DEVS formalism preserves a hierarchical, modular modeling fashion and a coupling scheme. Furthermore, for the GK-DEVS model simulation, we propose an abstract simulation algorithm, called a GK-Simulator, in which data and control are separated and events are scheduled not globally but hierarchically so that an object-oriented principle is satisfied.

Agent technology is an exciting and important new way to create complex software systems. Agents blend many of the traditional properties of AI programs - knowledge-level reasoning, flexibility, proactiveness, goal-directedness, and so forth - with insights gained from distributed software engineering, machine learning, negotiation and teamwork theory, and the social sciences. An important part of the agent approach is the principle that agents (like humans) can function more effectively in groups that are characterized by cooperation and division of labor. Agent programs are designed to autonomously collaborate with each other in order to satisfy both their internal goals and the shared external demands generated by virtue of their participation in agent societies. This type of collaboration depends on a sophisticated system of inter-agent communication.

Under the new interpretation, the matched pole-zero model is shown to be structurally identical to a hold-equivalent discrete-time model, where the generalised hold takes integral part, thus unifying the most widely used discretisation approaches. An algorithm for obtaining the generalised hold function is presented. The hold-equivalent structure of the matched pole-zero model clarifies several discrete-time system properties, such as controllability and observability, and their preservation or loss with a matched pole-zero discretisation.

Many NP-hard languages can be \"decided\" in subexponential time if the definition of \"decide\" is relaxed only slightly.

Goldreich, Goldwasser, and Ron constructed property testers with constant query complexity for dense instances of a large class of graph problems. Since many graph problems can be viewed as special cases of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem on Boolean domains, it is natural to try to construct property testers for more general cases of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem. In this paper, we give explicit constructions of property testers using a constant number of queries for dense instances of Constraint Satisfaction Problems where the constraints have constant arity and the variables assume values in some domain of finite size", "1534": "Generic simulation approach for multi-axis machining. Part 1: modeling methodology. This paper presents a new methodology for analytically simulating multi-axis machining of complex sculptured surfaces. A generalized approach is developed for representing an arbitrary cutting edge design, and the local surface topology of a complex sculptured surface. A NURBS curve is used to represent the cutting edge profile. This approach offers the advantages of representing any arbitrary cutting edge design in a generic way, as well as providing standardized techniques for manipulating the location and orientation of the cutting edge. The local surface topology of the part is defined as those surfaces generated by previous tool paths in the vicinity of the current tool position. The local surface topology of the part is represented without using a computationally expensive CAD system. A systematic prediction technique is then developed to determine the instantaneous tool/part interaction during machining. The methodology employed here determines the cutting edge in-cut segments by determining the intersection between the NURBS curve representation of the cutting edge and the defined local surface topology. These in-cut segments are then utilized for predicting instantaneous chip load, static and dynamic cutting forces, and tool deflection. Part 1 of this paper details the modeling methodology and demonstrates the capabilities of the simulation for machining a complex surface", "1685": "Use of web technologies in construction project management: what are the critical success/failure factors?. A concept of how the World Wide Web (WWW) and its associated technologies can be used to manage construction projects has been recognized by practitioners in the construction industry for quite sometime.

It promises, to enhance construction project documentation and control, and to revolutionize the way construction project teams process and transmit project information.

A key issue for cadastral systems is the maintenance of their correctness. Correctness is defined to be the proper correspondence between the valid legal situation and the content of the cadastre. This correspondence is generally difficult to achieve, since the cadastre is not a complete representation of all aspects influencing the legal situation in reality. The goal of the paper is to develop a formal model comprising representations of the cadastre and of reality that allows the simulation and investigation of cases where this correspondence is potentially violated. For this purpose the model consists of two parts, the first part represents the valid legal situation and the second part represents the cadastre. This makes it feasible to mark the differences between reality and the cadastre. The marking together with the two parts of the model facilitate the discussion of issues in \"real-world\" cadastral systems where incorrectness occurs. In order to develop a formal model, the paper uses the transfer of ownership of a parcel between two persons as minimal case study. The foundation for the formalization is a modern version of the situation calculus. The focus moves from the analysis of the cadastre to the preparation of a conceptual and a formalized model and the implementation of a prototype", "1799": "Steady-state mean-square error analysis of the cross-correlation and constant modulus algorithm in a MIMO convolutive system.

In this paper, experts' opinions are described in linguistic terms which can be expressed in trapezoidal (or triangular) fuzzy numbers. To make the consensus of the experts consistent, we utilize the fuzzy Delphi method to adjust the fuzzy rating of every expert to achieve the consensus condition. For the aggregate of many experts' opinions, we take the operation of fuzzy numbers to get the mean of fuzzy rating, x/sub ij/ and the mean of weight, w/sub .j/. In multi-alternatives and multi-attributes cases, the fuzzy decision matrix X=[x/sub ij/]/sub m*n/ is constructed by means of the fuzzy rating, x/sub ij/. Then, we can derive the aggregate fuzzy numbers by multiplying the fuzzy decision matrix with the corresponding fuzzy attribute weights. The final results become a problem of ranking fuzzy numbers. We also propose an easy procedure of using fuzzy numbers to rank aggregate fuzzy numbers A/sub i/. In this way, we can obtain the best selection for evaluating the system. For practical application, we propose an algorithm for evaluating the best main battle tank by fuzzy decision theory and comparing it with other methods", "1746": "The exact solution of coupled thermoelectroelastic behavior of piezoelectric laminates.

We consider a problem of delivery planning over multiple time periods. Deliveries must be made to customers having nominated demand in each time period. Demand must be met in each time period by use of some combination of inhomogeneous service providers. Each service provider has a different delivery capacity, different cost of delivery to each customer, a different utilisation requirement, and different rules governing the spread of deliveries in time. The problem is to plan deliveries so as to minimise overall costs, subject to demand being met and service rules obeyed. A natural integer programming model was found to be intractable, except on problems with loose demand constraints, with gaps between best lower bound and best feasible solution of up to 35.1%, with an average of 15.4% over the test data set. In all but the problem with loosest demand constraints, Cplex 6.5 applied to this formulation failed to find the optimal solution before running out of memory.

The authors present a performance-robustness evaluation of the recently developed minimal resource allocation network (MRAN) for equalisation in highly nonlinear magnetic recording channels in disc storage systems. Unlike communication systems, equalisation of signals in these channels is a difficult problem, as they are corrupted by data-dependent noise and highly nonlinear distortions.

In the present paper, the performance of the MSDR equaliser is compared with that of the MRAN equaliser using a magnetic recording channel model, under Conditions that include variations in partial erasure, jitter, width and noise power, as well as model mismatch. Results from the study indicate that the less complex MRAN equaliser gives consistently better performance robustness than the MSDR equaliser in terms of signal to distortion ratios (SDRs)", "1779": "Maybe it's not too late to join the circus: books for midlife career management.

Recently, various algebraic integer programming (IP) solvers have been proposed based on the theory of Grobner bases. The main difficulty of these solvers is the size of the Grobner bases generated.

Some improvements have been proposed such as Hosten and Sturmfels' method (GRIN) designed to avoid additional variables and Thomas' truncated Grobner basis method which computes the reduced Grobner basis for a specific IP problem IP/sub A,C/(b) (rather than its generalisation IPA,C). In this paper we propose a new algebraic algorithm for solving IP problems. The new algorithm, called Minimised Geometric Buchberger Algorithm, combines Hosten and Sturmfels' GRIN and Thomas' truncated Grobner basis method to compute the fundamental segments of an IP problem IP/sub A,C/ directly in its original space and also the truncated Grobner basis for a specific IP problem IP/sub A,C/ (b).

Simulation of power electronic circuits remains a problem due to the high level of stiffness brought about by the modelling of switches as biresistors i.e. very low turn-on resistance and very high turn-off resistance.

A modelling solution for ensuring numerically stable, accurate and fast simulation of power electronic systems is proposed. The solution enables easy connectivity between power electronic elements in the simulation model. It involves the modelling of virtual capacitance at switching nodes to soften voltage discontinuity due to the switch current suddenly going to zero. Undesirable ringing effects that may arise due to the interaction between the virtual capacitance and circuit inductance are eliminated by modelling virtual damping resistors in parallel to inductors that are adjacent to switching elements. A midpoint configuration method is also introduced for modelling shunt capacitors. A DC traction system is simulated using this modelling strategy and the results are included.

For multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) systems, it is important to determine how accurately operators can control each DOF and what influence perceptual, information processing, and psychomotor components have on performance.

To separate perceptual and psychomotor effects, we used 2 control-display mappings that differed in the coupling of vertical and depth dimensions to the up-down and fore-aft control axes. We observed information processing effects in the positioning task: Initial error correction on the vertical dimension lagged in time behind the horizontal dimension. The depth dimension error correction lagged behind both, which was ascribed to the poorer perceptual information. We observed this perceptual effect also in the tracking experiment. Motor effects were also present, with tracking errors along the up-down axis of the hand controller being 1.1 times larger than along the fore-aft axis.

This paper presents a method to increase the accountability of certificate management by making it intractable for the certification authority (CA) to create contradictory statements about the validity of a certificate.

Such an attestation can be verified by obtaining in an authenticated way the published digest and applying a verification algorithm to the triple of the bitstring, the attestation and the digest. The most important feature of this primitive is the intractability of creating two contradictory proofs for the same candidate element x and digest. We give an efficient construction for undeniable attesters based on authenticated search trees. We show that the construction also applies to sets of more structured elements. We also show that undeniable attesters exist iff collision-resistant hash functions exist", "1852": "The design and performance evaluation of alternative XML storage strategies.

An algorithm combining neural networks with the fundamental parameters equations (NNFP) is proposed for making corrections for non-linear matrix effects in x-ray fluorescence analysis. In the algorithm, neural networks were applied to relate the concentrations of components to both the measured intensities and the relative theoretical intensities calculated by the fundamental parameter equations. The NNFP algorithm is compared with the classical theoretical correction models, including the fundamental parameters approach, the Lachance-Traill model, a hyperbolic function model and the COLA algorithm. For an alloy system with 15 measured elements, in most cases, the prediction errors of the NNFP algorithm are lower than those of the fundamental parameters approach, the Lachance-Traill model, the hyperbolic function model and the COLA algorithm separately. If there are the serious matrix effects, such as matrix effects among Cr, Fe and Ni, the NNFP algorithm generally decreased predictive errors as compared with the classical models, except for the case of Cr by the fundamental parameters approach. The main reason why the NNFP algorithm has generally a better predictive ability than the classical theoretical correction models might be that neural networks can better calibrate the non-linear matrix effects in a complex multivariate system", "1854": "Software Technology: looking for quality accountants.

The current Web service model treats all requests equivalently, both while being processed by servers and while being transmitted over the network. For some uses, such as multiple priority schemes, different levels of service are desirable. We propose application-level TCP connection management mechanisms for Web servers to provide two different levels of Web service, high and low service, by setting different time-outs for inactive TCP connections. We evaluated the performance of the mechanism under heavy and light loading conditions on the Web server. Our experiments show that, though heavy traffic saturates the network, high level class performance is improved by as much as 25-28%. Therefore, this mechanism can effectively provide QoS guaranteed services even in the absence of operating system and network supports", "1675": "An operations research approach to the problem of the sugar cane selection. Selection for superior clones is the most important aspect of sugar cane improvement programs, and is a long and expensive process. While studies have investigated different components of selection independently, there has not been a whole system approach to improve the process. This study observes the problem as an integrated system, where if one parameter changes the state of the whole system changes. A computer based stochastic simulation model that accurately represents the selection was developed. The paper describes the simulation model, showing its accuracy as well as how a combination of dynamic programming and branch and bound can be applied to the model to optimise the selection system, giving a new application of these techniques. The model can be directly applied to any region targeted by sugar cane breeding programs or to other clonally propagated crops", "1889": "Sliding mode dynamics in continuous feedback control for distributed discrete-event scheduling. A continuous feedback control approach for real-time scheduling of discrete events is presented motivated by the need for control theoretic techniques to analyze and design such systems in distributed manufacturing applications. These continuous feedback control systems exhibit highly nonlinear and discontinuous dynamics. Specifically, when the production demand in the manufacturing system exceeds the available resource capacity then the control system \"chatters\" and exhibits sliding modes. This sliding mode behavior is advantageously used in the scheduling application by allowing the system to visit different schedules within an infinitesimal region near the sliding surface. In the paper, an analytical model is developed to characterize the sliding mode dynamics. This model is then used to design controllers in the sliding mode domain to improve the effectiveness of the control system to \"search\" for schedules with good performance. Computational results indicate that the continuous feedback control approach can provide near-optimal schedules and that it is computationally efficient compared to existing scheduling techniques", "1717": "Responding to market trends with predictive segmentation [health care]. Technology and technological advances have always been a part of healthcare, but often it's advances in treatment machinery and materials that get the attention. However, technology gains also occur behind the scenes in operations. One of the less glamorous but powerful technological advances available today is predictive segmentation, a phrase that means \"a new way to assess and view individuals in the market based on their health status and health needs.\" Sophisticated databases, data mining, neural networks and statistical capabilities have enabled the development of predictive segmentation techniques. These predictive models for healthcare can identify who is likely to need certain services and who is likely to become ill. They are a significant departure from various geographical and attitudinal segmentation methods that healthcare strategists have used in the past to gain a better understanding of their customers", "1524": "Organizational design, information transfer, and the acquisition of rent-producing resources. Within the resource-based view of the firm, a dynamic story has emerged in which the knowledge accumulated over the history of a firm and embedded in organizational routines and structures influences the firm's ability to recognize the value of new resources and capabilities. This paper explores the possibility of firms to select organizational designs that increase the likelihood that they will recognize and value rent-producing resources and capabilities. A computational model is developed to study the tension between an organization's desire to explore its environment for new capabilities and the organization's need to exploit existing capabilities. Support is provided for the proposition that integration, both externally and internally, is an important source of dynamic capability. The model provides greater insight into the tradeoffs between these two forms of integration and suggests when one form may be preferred over another. In particular, evidence is provided that in uncertain environments, the ability to explore possible alternatives is critical while in more certain environments, the ability to transfer information internally is paramount", "1676": "An optimization based approach to the train operator scheduling problem at Singapore MRT.

We report on an optimization based approach to develop a computerized train-operator scheduling system that has been implemented at SMRT. The approach involves a bipartite matching algorithm for the generation of night duties and a tabu search algorithm for the generation of day duties. The system automates the train-operator scheduling process at SMRT and produces favorable schedules in comparison with the manual process. It is also able to handle the multiple objectives inherent in the crew scheduling system. While trying to minimize the system wide crew-related costs, the system is also able to address concern with respect to the number of split duties", "1861": "Technology in distance education: a global perspective to alternative delivery mechanisms. Technology is providing a positive impact on delivery mechanisms employed in distance education at the university level. Some institutions are incorporating distance education as a way to extend the classroom. Other institutions are investigating new delivery mechanisms, which support a revised perspective on education. These latter institutions are revising their processes for interacting with students, and taking a more \"learner centered\" approach to the delivery of education. This article discusses the impact of technology on the delivery mechanisms employed in distance education. A framework is proposed here, which presents a description of alternative modes of generic delivery mechanisms. It is suggested that those institutions, which adopt a delivery mechanism employing an asynchronous mode, can gain the most benefit from technology. This approach seems to represent the only truly innovative use of technology in distance education.

This paper addresses the design and development of a CD-ROM learning resource for food and beverage. It is a learning resource which is designed to integrate with rather than to replace existing conventional classroom and laboratory learning methods and, thus, compensate for the decline in the resource base faced in food and beverage education in recent years.

In this paper the theory of fuzzy logic and fuzzy reasoning is combined with the theory of Markov systems and the concept of a fuzzy non-homogeneous Markov system is introduced for the first time. This is an effort to deal with the uncertainty introduced in the estimation of the transition probabilities and the input probabilities in Markov systems. The asymptotic behaviour of the fuzzy Markov system and its asymptotic variability is considered and given in closed analytic form. Moreover, the asymptotically attainable structures of the system are estimated also in a closed analytic form under some realistic assumptions. The importance of this result lies in the fact that in most cases the traditional methods for estimating the probabilities can not be used due to lack of data and measurement errors. The introduction of fuzzy logic into Markov systems represents a powerful tool for taking advantage of the symbolic knowledge that the experts of the systems possess", "1906": "Integrated process control using an in situ sensor for etch. The migration to tighter geometries and more complex process sequence integration schemes requires having the ability to compensate for upstream deviations from target specifications. Doing so ensures that-downstream process sequences operate on work-in-progress that is well within control. Because point-of-use visibility of work-in-progress quality has become of paramount concern in the industry's drive to reduce scrap and improve yield, controlling trench depth has assumed greater importance. An integrated, interferometric based, rate monitor for etch-to-depth and spacer etch applications has been developed for controlling this parameter.

Constant advances in audio/video compression, the development of the multicast protocol as well as fast improvement in computing devices (e.g. higher speed, larger memory) have set forth the opportunity to have resource demanding videoconferencing (VC) sessions on the Internet. Multicast is supported by the multicast backbone (Mbone), which is a special portion of the Internet where this protocol is being deployed. Mbone VC tools are steadily emerging and the user population is growing fast. VC is a fascinating application that has the potential to greatly impact the way we remotely communicate and work. Yet, the adoption of VC is not as fast as one could have predicted. Hence, it is important to examine the factors that affect a widespread adoption of VC.

This paper studies adaptive thinning strategies for approximating a large set of scattered data by piecewise linear functions over triangulated subsets. Our strategies depend on both the locations of the data points in the plane, and the values of the sampled function at these points - adaptive thinning. All our thinning strategies remove data points one by one, so as to minimize an estimate of the error that results by the removal of a point from the current set of points (this estimate is termed \"anticipated error\"). The thinning process generates subsets of \"most significant\" points, such that the piecewise linear interpolants over the Delaunay triangulations of these subsets approximate progressively the function values sampled at the original scattered points, and such that the approximation errors are small relative to the number of points in the subsets. We design various methods for computing the anticipated error at reasonable cost, and compare and test the performance of the methods. It is proved that for data sampled from a convex function, with the strategy of convex triangulation, the actual error is minimized by minimizing the best performing measure of anticipated error. It is also shown that for data sampled from certain quadratic polynomials, adaptive thinning is equivalent to thinning which depends only on the locations of the data points - nonadaptive thinning. Based on our numerical tests and comparisons, two practical adaptive thinning algorithms are proposed for thinning large data sets, one which is more accurate and another which is faster", "1669": "Supply chain optimisation in the paper industry.

The motion of surface waves under the effect of bottom is a very interesting and challenging phenomenon in the nature. we use boundary integral method to compute and analyze this problem. In the linear analysis, the linearized equations have bounded error increase under some compatible conditions. This contributes to the cancellation of instable Kelvin-Helmholtz terms. Under the effect of bottom, the existence of equations is hard to determine, but given some limitations it proves true. These limitations are that the swing of interfaces should be small enough, and the distance between surface and bottom should be large enough. In order to maintain the stability of computation, some compatible relationship must be satisfied. In the numerical examples, the simulation of standing waves and breaking waves are calculated.

Near-infrared (NIR) diffuse tomography is an emerging method for imaging the interior of tissues to quantify concentrations of hemoglobin and exogenous chromophores noninvasively in vivo. It often exploits an optical diffusion model-based image reconstruction algorithm to estimate spatial property values from measurements of the light flux at the surface of the tissue. In this study, mean-squared error (MSE) over the image is used to evaluate methods for regularizing the ill-posed inverse image reconstruction problem in NIR tomography. Estimates of image bias and image standard deviation were calculated based upon 100 repeated reconstructions of a test image with randomly distributed noise added to the light flux measurements. It was observed that the bias error dominates at high regularization parameter values while variance dominates as the algorithm is allowed to approach the optimal solution. This optimum does not necessarily correspond to the minimum projection error solution, but typically requires further iteration with a decreasing regularization parameter to reach the lowest image error. Increasing measurement noise causes a need to constrain the minimum regularization parameter to higher values in order to achieve a minimum in the overall image MSE", "1496": "Web ad explosion.

Although the establishment of a land administration system is enough of a challenge as it is, the task of keeping the system up to date with developments in society is even more challenging.

The paper aims to analyse the developments that might occur in a society with respect to tenure, value and use of land. These developments constitute a dynamic component of land administration.

The control parameter can be quantitatively determined with a compromise between the disturbance response and the robustness. Four specifications: (normalised) maximum dynamic error, maximum decay rate, (normalised) control action bound and approximate recovery time are used to characterise the step-disturbance response.

When an XML document conforms to a given type (e.g. a DTD or an XML schema type) it is called a valid document.

In practice however, XML documents are often generated dynamically, by some program: checking whether all XML documents generated by the program are valid WRT a given type is called the typechecking problem. While a validation analyzes an XML document, a type checker analyzes a program, and the problem's difficulty is a function of the language in which that program is expressed. The XML typechecking problem has been investigated recently and the XQuery Working Group adopted some of these techniques for typechecking XQuery.

The focus of this paper is on the relationship between accuracy of multivariate refinable vector and vector cascade algorithm. We show that, if the vector cascade algorithm (1.5) with isotropic dilation converges to a vector-valued function with regularity, then the initial function must satisfy the Strang-Fix conditions", "1538": "A heuristic approach to resource locations in broadband networks. In broadband networks, such as ATM, the importance of dynamic migration of data resources is increasing because of its potential to improve performance especially for transaction processing. In environments with migratory data resources, it is necessary to have mechanisms to manage the locations of each data resource. In this paper, we present an algorithm that makes use of system state information and heuristics to manage locations of data resources in a distributed network. In the proposed algorithm, each site maintains information about state of other sites with respect to each data resource of the system and uses it to find: (1) a subset of sites likely to have the requested data resource; and (2) the site where the data resource is to be migrated from the current site. The proposed algorithm enhances its effectiveness by continuously updating system state information stored at each site. It focuses on reducing the overall average time delay needed by the transaction requests to locate and access the migratory data resources. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm and also compared it with one of the existing location management algorithms, by simulation studies under several system parameters such as the frequency of requests generation, frequency of data resource migrations, network topology and scale of network. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in all cases", "1479": "Agreeing with automated diagnostic aids: a study of users' concurrence strategies. Automated diagnostic aids that are less than perfectly reliable often produce unwarranted levels of disuse by operators. In the present study, users' tendencies to either agree or disagree with automated diagnostic aids were examined under conditions in which: (1) the aids were less than perfectly reliable but aided-diagnosis was still more accurate that unaided diagnosis; and (2) the system was completely opaque, affording users no additional information upon which to base a diagnosis. The results revealed that some users adopted a strategy of always agreeing with the aids, thereby maximizing the number of correct diagnoses made over several trials. Other users, however, adopted a probability-matching strategy in which agreement and disagreement rates matched the rate of correct and incorrect diagnoses of the aids. The probability-matching strategy, therefore, resulted in diagnostic accuracy scores that were lower than was maximally possible. Users who adopted the maximization strategy had higher self-ratings of problem-solving and decision-making skills, were more accurate in estimating aid reliabilities, and were more confident in their diagnosis on trials in which they agreed with the aids. The potential applications of these findings include the design of interface and training solutions that facilitate the adoption of the most effective concurrence strategies by users of automated diagnostic aids", "1914": "Vacuum-compatible vibration isolation stack for an interferometric gravitational wave detector TAMA300. Interferometric gravitational wave detectors require a large degree of vibration isolation. For this purpose, a multilayer stack constructed of rubber and metal blocks is suitable, because it provides isolation in all degrees of freedom at once. In TAMA300, a 300 m interferometer in Japan, long-term dimensional stability and compatibility with an ultrahigh vacuum environment of about 10/sup -6/ Pa are also required. To keep the interferometer at its operating point despite ground strain and thermal drift of the isolation system, a thermal actuator was introduced. To prevent the high outgassing rate of the rubber from spoiling the vacuum, the rubber blocks were enclosed by gas-tight bellows. Using these techniques, we have successfully developed a three-layer stack which has a vibration isolation ratio of more than 10/sup 3/ at 300 Hz with control of drift and enough vacuum compatibility", "1856": "Tax forms: CD or not CD?.

In order to support dynamic setup of business processes among independent organizations, a formal standard schema for describing the business processes is basically required. The ebXML framework provides such a specification schema called BPSS (Business Process Specification Schema) which is available in two standalone representations: a UML version, and an XML version. The former, however, is not intended for the direct creation of business process specifications, but for defining specification elements and their relationships required for creating an ebXML-compliant business process specification. For this reason, it is very important to support conceptual modeling that is well organized and directly matched with major modeling concepts. This paper deals with how to represent and manage B2B business processes using UML-compliant diagrams. The major challenge is to organize UML diagrams in a natural way that is well suited to the business process meta-model and then to transform the diagrams into an XML version. This paper demonstrates the usefulness of conceptually modeling business processes by prototyping a business process editor tool called ebDesigner", "1494": "Where have all the PC makers gone?.

An adaptive tracking control design for robotic systems using Gaussian wavelet networks is proposed. A Gaussian wavelet network with accurate approximation capability is employed to approximate the unknown dynamics of robotic systems by using an adaptive learning algorithm that can learn the parameters of the dilation and translation of Gaussian wavelet functions. Depending on the finite number of wavelet basis functions which result in inevitable approximation errors, a robust control law is provided to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop robotic system that can be proved by Lyapunov theory.

This paper deals with the application of receding horizon methods to hover and forward flight models of an experimental tethered flying wing developed at Caltech. The dynamics of the system are representative of a vertical landing and take off aircraft, such as a Harrier around hover, or a thrust-vectored aircraft such as F18-HARV or X-31 in forward flight. The adopted control methodology is a hybrid of receding horizon techniques and control Lyapunov function (CLF)-based ideas. First, a CLF is generated using quasi-LPV methods and then, by using the CLF as the terminal cost in the receding horizon optimization, stability is guaranteed. The main advantage of this approach is that stability can be guaranteed without imposing constraints in the on-line optimization, allowing the problem to be solved in a more efficient manner. Models of the experimental set-up are obtained for the hover and forward flight modes. Numerical simulations for different time horizons are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the discussed methods. Specifically, it is shown that a mere upper bound on the cost-to-go is not an appropriate choice for a terminal cost, when the horizon length is short. Simulation results are presented using experimentally verified model parameters", "1465": "P systems with symport/antiport rules: the traces of objects. We continue the study of those P systems where the computation is performed by the communication of objects, that is, systems with symport and antiport rules. Instead of the (number of) objects collected in a specified membrane, as the result of a computation we consider the itineraries of a certain object through membranes, during a halting computation, written as a coding of the string of labels of the visited membranes. The family of languages generated in this way is investigated with respect to its place in the Chomsky hierarchy. When the (symport and antiport) rules are applied in a conditional manner, promoted or inhibited by certain objects which should be present in the membrane where a rule is applied, then a characterization of recursively enumerable languages is obtained; the power of systems with the rules applied freely is only partially described", "1903": "The BLISS programming language: a history. The BLISS programming language was invented by William A. Wulf and others at Carnegie-Mellon University in 1969, originally for the DEC PDP-10. BLISS-10 caught the interest of Ronald F. Brender of DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation). After several years of collaboration, including the creation of BLISS-11 for the PDP-11, BLISS was adopted as DEC's implementation language for use on its new line of VAX computers in 1975. DEC developed a completely new generation of BLISSs for the VAX, PDP-10 and PDP-11, which became widely used at DEC during the 1970s and 1980s. With the creation of the Alpha architecture in the early 1990s, BLISS was extended again, in both 32- and 64-bit flavors. BLISS support for the Intel IA-32 architecture was introduced in 1995 and IA-64 support is now in progress. BLISS has a number of unusual characteristics: it is typeless, requires use of an explicit contents of operator (written as a period or 'dot'), takes an algorithmic approach to data structure definition, has no goto, is an expression language, and has an unusually rich compile-time language. This paper reviews the evolution and use of BLISS over its three decade lifetime. Emphasis is on how the language evolved to facilitate portable programming while retaining its initial highly machine-specific character. Finally, the success of its characteristics are assessed", "1901": "FC++: Functional tools for object-oriented tasks. FC++ is a library for programming functionally in C++.

In this paper, we show how FC++ can be used in common object-oriented programming tasks. We demonstrate FC++ implementations of several common design patterns (Adapter, Builder, Command, and more). Compared to conventional C++ implementations of these patterns, our implementations are either simpler (in that fewer classes/dependencies are needed), more efficient, or more type-safe (thanks to parametric polymorphism and type inference)", "1634": "Maple 8 keeps everyone happy.

I. Lamina theory. It is well known that a structural design with isotropic materials can only be accomplished based on a stress failure criterion. This is, however, generally not true with laminated composites. Only when the laminate is subjected to an in-plane load, can the ultimate failure of the laminate correspond to its last-ply failure, and hence a stress failure criterion may be sufficient to detect the maximum load that can be sustained by the laminate. Even in such a case, the load shared by each lamina in the laminate cannot be correctly determined if the lamina instantaneous stiffness matrix is inaccurately provided, since the lamina is always statically indeterminate in the laminate. If, however, the laminate is subjected to a lateral load, its ultimate failure occurs before last-ply failure and use of the stress failure criterion is no longer sufficient; an additional critical deflection or curvature condition must also be employed. This necessitates development of an efficient constitutive relationship for laminated composites in order that the laminate strains/deflections up to ultimate failure can be accurately calculated. A general constitutive description for the thermomechanical response of a fibrous laminate up to ultimate failure with applications to various fibrous laminates is presented in the two papers. The constitutive relationship is obtained by combining classical lamination theory with a recently developed bridging micromechanics model, through a layer-by-layer analysis.

The computation of the frequency response of systems depending affinely on uncertain parameters can be reduced to that of all its one-dimensional edge plants while the image of such an edge plant at a fixed frequency is an arc or a line segment in the complex plane. Based on this conclusion, four computational formulas of the maximal and minimal (maxi-mini) magnitudes and phases of an edge plant at a fixed frequency are given. The formulas, besides sharing a simpler form of expression, concretely display how the extrema of the frequency response of the edge plant relate to the typical characteristics of the arc and line segment such as the centre, radius and tangent points of the arc, the distance from the origin to the line segment etc. The direct application of the results is to compute the Bode-, Nichols- and Nyquist-plot collections of the systems which are needed in robustness analysis and design", "1707": "Tactical airborne reconnaissance goes dual-band and beyond.

A nonlinear iterative smoothing filter based on a second-order partial differential equation is introduced. It smooths out the image according to an anisotropic diffusion process. The approach is based on a smooth approximation of the total variation (TV) functional which overcomes the non-differentiability of the TV functional at the origin. In particular, the authors perform linear smoothing over smooth areas but selective smoothing over candidate edges. By relating the smoothing parameter to the time step, they arrive at a CFL condition which guarantees the causality of the discrete scheme. This allows the adoption of higher time discretisation steps, while ensuring the absence of artefacts deriving from the non-smooth behaviour of the TV functional at the origin. In particular, it is shown that the proposed approach avoids the typical staircase effects in smooth areas which occur in the standard time-marching TV scheme", "1921": "An ACL for a dynamic system of agents. In this article we present the design of an ACL for a dynamic system of agents. The ACL includes a set of conversation performatives extended with operations to register, create, and terminate agents. The main design goal at the agent-level is to provide only knowledge-level primitives that are well integrated with the dynamic nature of the system. This goal has been achieved by defining an anonymous interaction protocol which enables agents to request and supply knowledge without considering symbol-level issues concerning management of agent names, routing, and agent reachability. This anonymous interaction protocol exploits a distributed facilitator schema which is hidden at the agent-level and provides mechanisms for registering capabilities of agents and delivering requests according to the competence of agents. We present a formal specification of the ACL and of the underlying architecture, exploiting an algebra of actors, and illustrate it with the help of a graphical notation. This approach provides the basis for discussing dynamic primitives in ACL and for studying properties of dynamic multi agent systems, for example concerning the behavior of agents and the correctness of their conversation policies", "1615": "Laguerre approximation of fractional systems.

We present the definition of the therapy decision task and its associated Heuristic Multi-Attribute (HM) solving method, in the form of a KADS-style specification. The goal of the therapy decision task is to identify the ideal therapy, for a given patient, in accordance with a set of objectives of a diverse nature constituting a global therapy-evaluation framework in which considerations such as patient preferences and quality-of-life results are integrated. We give a high-level overview of this task as a specialisation of the generic decision task, and additional decomposition methods for the subtasks involved.

The first section of this paper offers a detailed explanation of the model calibration procedure. A new methodology is presented for accurately determining the cutting force coefficients for multi-axis machining. The force model presented in Part 1 is reformulated so that the cutting force coefficients account for the effects of feed rate, cutting speed, and a complex cutting edge design.

This study investigated how common online text affects reading performance of elementary school-age children by examining the actual and perceived readability of four computer-displayed typefaces at 12- and 14-point sizes. Twenty-seven children, ages 9 to 11, were asked to read eight children's passages and identify erroneous/substituted words while reading. Comic Sans MS, Arial and Times New Roman typefaces, regardless of size, were found to be more readable (as measured by a reading efficiency score) than Courier New. No differences in reading speed were found for any of the typeface combinations. In general, the 14-point size and the examined sans serif typefaces were perceived as being the easiest to read, fastest, most attractive, and most desirable for school-related material. In addition, participants significantly preferred Comic Sans MS and 14-point Arial to 12-point Courier.

Contrast sensitivity was determined as a function of target velocity (0 degrees -120 degrees /s) over a variety of viewing conditions. In Experiment 1, measurements of dynamic contrast sensitivity were determined for observers as a function of target velocity for letter stimuli. Significant main effects were found for target velocity, target size, and target duration, but significant interactions among the variables indicated especially pronounced adverse effects of increasing target velocity for small targets and brief durations. In Experiment 2, the effects of simulated cataracts were determined. Although the simulated impairment had no effect on traditional acuity scores, dynamic contrast sensitivity was markedly reduced. Results are discussed in terms of dynamic contrast sensitivity as a useful composite measure of visual functioning that may provide a better overall picture of an individual's visual functioning than does traditional static acuity, dynamic acuity, or contrast sensitivity alone. The measure of dynamic contrast sensitivity may increase understanding of the practical effects of various conditions, such as aging or disease, on the visual system, or it may allow improved prediction of individuals' performance in visually dynamic situations", "1890": "Robustness of trajectories with finite time extent. The problem of estimating perturbation bounds of finite trajectories is considered. The trajectory is assumed to be generated by a linear system with uncertainty characterized in terms of integral quadratic constraints.

The result can be used in robustness analysis of hybrid systems and switched dynamical systems", "1627": "Blind identification of non-stationary MA systems. A new adaptive algorithm for blind identification of time-varying MA channels is derived. This algorithm proposes the use of a novel system of equations derived by combining the third- and fourth-order statistics of the output signals of MA models.

This algorithm shows good behaviour in arbitrary noisy environments and good performance in tracking time-varying systems", "181": "Electromagnetics computations using the MPI parallel implementation of the steepest descent fast multipole method (SDFMM). The computational solution of large-scale linear systems of equations necessitates the use of fast algorithms but is also greatly enhanced by employing parallelization techniques. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the speedup achieved by the MPI (message passing interface) parallel implementation of the steepest descent fast multipole method (SDFMM). Although this algorithm has already been optimized to take advantage of the structure of the physics of scattering problems, there is still the opportunity to speed up the calculation by dividing tasks into components using multiple processors and solve them in parallel. The SDFMM has three bottlenecks ordered as (1) filling the sparse impedance matrix associated with the near-field method of moments interactions (MoM), (2) the matrix vector multiplications associated with this sparse matrix and (3) the far field interactions associated with the fast multipole method. The parallel implementation task is accomplished using a thirty-one node Intel Pentium Beowulf cluster and is also validated on a 4-processor Alpha workstation. The Beowulf cluster consists of thirty-one nodes of 350 MHz Intel Pentium IIs with 256 MB of RAM and one node of a 4*450 MHz Intel Pentium II Xeon shared memory processor with 2 GB of RAM with all nodes connected to a 100 BaseTX Ethernet network. The Alpha workstation has a maximum of four 667 MHz processors. Our numerical results show significant linear speedup in filling the sparse impedance matrix.

This article aims to show that linguistics, in particular the study of the lexico-syntactic aspects of language, provides fertile ground for artificial life modeling. A survey of the models that have been developed over the last decade and a half is presented to demonstrate that ALife techniques have a lot to offer an explanatory theory of language. It is argued that this is because much of the structure of language is determined by the interaction of three complex adaptive systems: learning, culture, and biological evolution. Computational simulation, informed by theoretical linguistics, is an appropriate response to the challenge of explaining real linguistic data in terms of the processes that underpin human language", "1769": "Transformation rules and strategies for functional-logic programs.

During 2001, the Enterprise Engineering Laboratory at George Mason University was contracted by the Boeing Company to develop an eHub capability for aerospace suppliers in Taiwan. In a laboratory environment, the core technology was designed, developed, and tested, and now a large first-tier aerospace supplier in Taiwan is commercializing the technology. The project objective was to provide layered network and application services for transporting XML-based business transaction flows across multi-tier, heterogeneous data processing environments. This paper documents the business scenario, the eHub application, and the network transport mechanisms that were used to build the n-tier hub. In contrast to most eHubs, this solution takes the point of view of suppliers, pushing data in accordance with supplier requirements; hence, enhancing the probability of supplier adoption.

In the late 1990s, tightly coordinated airline schedules unraveled owing to massive delays resulting from inclement weather, overbooked flights, and airline operational difficulties. As schedules slipped, the delayed departures and late arrivals led to systemwide breakdowns, customers missed their connections, and airline work activities fell further out of sync. In offering possible answers, we emphasize the need to consider the customer as participant, following the human-centered computing model. Our study applied ethnographic methods to understand the airline system domain and the nature of airline delays, and it revealed the deficiencies of the airline production system model of operations. The research insights that led us to shift from a production and marketing system perspective to a customer-as-participant view might appear obvious to some readers. However, we do not know of any airline that designs its operations and technologies around any other model than the production and marketing system view. Our human-centered analysis used ethnographic methods to gather information, offering new insight into airline delays and suggesting effective ways to improve operations reliability", "1838": "Anticipating the further development of cadastral systems. Although the paper recognises the merits of the evolution of cadastral systems towards an increased capability over time, it promotes a radical introduction or overhaul of existing cadastral systems. It encourages the development of a capability to cope with some key drivers of major change. These have been identified as globalisation, the advent of fully automated cadastral environments, improved decentralised methods of governance and greatly improved service delivery of future cadastral systems to a wide range of users. The paper promotes the registration of title supported by government guarantee as an effective means for rapidly introducing cadastral systems to facilitate globally competitive land markets in developing countries. In developing automated environments for cadastral systems, the need to completely re-engineer and redesign cadastral systems to meet basic cadastral principles and responsiveness to individual user needs is promoted. In this environment, highly decentralised cadastral operations and administration combined with light regulatory control are advocated as a future governance strategy. With regard to the level of services to users, an emphasis on recognising and serving the future needs of users is seen as essential. International and national professional and user organisations involved in land administration are seen as an important vehicle for developing strategies and providing evaluation to guide the over-arching development of cadastral systems around the world", "1678": "Parallel interior point schemes for solving multistage convex programming. The predictor-corrector interior-point path-following algorithm is promising in solving multistage convex programming problems. Among many other general good features of this algorithm, especially attractive is that the algorithm allows the possibility to parallelise the major computations.

The study reported here investigates the influence of \"interactivity\" on the learning outcomes of users in a multimedia systems environment. Drawing from past literature base and based on key tenets of three learning theories - behaviorist, cognitivist, and constructivist - the study first proposes a measurement scheme for \"interactivity\" and then hypothesizes that \"interactivity\" would influence the learning outcomes positively in terms of users' learning achievement and attitude. Three prototypes of a multimedia instructional/training system to represent high, low, and noninteractive modes of use were developed and implemented and the hypothesized influences were investigated using a controlled laboratory research design. Multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) results indicate that while interactivity does not necessarily enable enhanced gain in user learning, it positively influences participants' attitude. The study finds no support for hypothesized moderating effects of learning styles (measured using Kolb's Learning Style Inventory scale) on the relationship between interactivity and user outcomes.

The generalized LR parsing algorithm for context-free grammars, introduced by Tomita in 1986, is a polynomial-time implementation of nondeterministic LR parsing that uses graph-structured stack to represent the contents of the nondeterministic parser's pushdown for all possible branches of computation at a single computation step. It has been specifically developed as a solution for practical parsing tasks arising in computational linguistics, and indeed has proved itself to be very suitable for natural language processing. Conjunctive grammars extend context-free grammars by allowing the use of an explicit intersection operation within grammar rules. This paper develops a new LR-style parsing algorithm for these grammars, which is based on the very same idea of a graph-structured pushdown, where the simultaneous existence of several paths in the graph is used to perform the mentioned intersection operation. The underlying finite automata are treated in the most general way: instead of showing the algorithm's correctness for some particular way of constructing automata, the paper defines a wide class of automata usable with a given grammar, which includes not only the traditional LR(k) automata, but also, for instance, a trivial automaton with a single reachable state. A modification of the SLR(k) table construction method that makes use of specific properties of conjunctive grammars is provided as one possible way of making finite automata to use with the algorithm", "1475": "Relation between glare and driving performance. The present study investigated the effects of discomfort glare on driving behavior. Participants (old and young; US and Europeans) were exposed to a simulated low- beam light source mounted on the hood of an instrumented vehicle. Participants drove at night in actual traffic along a track consisting of urban, rural, and highway stretches. The results show that the relatively low glare source caused a significant drop in detecting simulated pedestrians along the roadside and made participants drive significantly slower on dark and winding roads. Older participants showed the largest drop in pedestrian detection performance and reduced their driving speed the most. The results indicate that the de Boer rating scale, the most commonly used rating scale for discomfort glare, is practically useless as a predictor of driving performance. Furthermore, the maximum US headlamp intensity (1380 cd per headlamp) appears to be an acceptable upper limit", "178": "A parallelized indexing method for large-scale case-based reasoning. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a problem solving methodology commonly seen in artificial intelligence. It can correctly take advantage of the situations and methods in former cases to find out suitable solutions for new problems. CBR must accurately retrieve similar prior cases for getting a good performance. In the past, many researchers proposed useful technologies to handle this problem. However, the performance of retrieving similar cases may be greatly influenced by the number of cases. In this paper, the performance issue of large-scale CBR is discussed and a parallelized indexing architecture is then proposed for efficiently retrieving similar cases in large-scale CBR. Several algorithms for implementing the proposed architecture are also described. Some experiments are made and the results show the efficiency of the proposed method", "189": "Identification of linear parameter varying models. We consider identification of a certain class of discrete-time nonlinear systems known as linear parameter varying system. We assume that inputs, outputs and the scheduling parameters are directly measured, and a form of the functional dependence of the system coefficients on the parameters is known. We show how this identification problem can be reduced to a linear regression, and provide compact formulae for the corresponding least mean square and recursive least-squares algorithms. We derive conditions on persistency of excitation in terms of the inputs and scheduling parameter trajectories when the functional dependence is of polynomial type. These conditions have a natural polynomial interpolation interpretation, and do not require the scheduling parameter trajectories to vary slowly. This method is illustrated with a simulation example using two different parameter trajectories", "154": "Verifying concurrent systems with symbolic execution. Current techniques for interactively proving temporal properties of concurrent systems translate transition systems into temporal formulas by introducing program counter variables.

Conversations are sequences of messages exchanged among interacting agents. For conversations to be meaningful, agents ought to follow commonly known specifications limiting the types of messages that can be exchanged at any point in the conversation. These specifications are usually implemented using conversation policies (which are rules of inference) or conversation protocols (which are predefined conversation templates). In this article we present a semantic model for specifying conversations using conversation policies. This model is based on the principles that the negotiation and uptake of shared social commitments entail the adoption of obligations to action, which indicate the actions that agents have agreed to perform. In the same way, obligations are retracted based on the negotiation to discharge their corresponding shared social commitments. Based on these principles, conversations are specified as interaction specifications that model the ideal sequencing of agent participations negotiating the execution of actions in a joint activity. These specifications not only specify the adoption and discharge of shared commitments and obligations during an activity, but also indicate the commitments and obligations that are required (as preconditions) or that outlive a joint activity (as postconditions). We model the Contract Net Protocol as an example of the specification of conversations in a joint activity", "1917": "Design and modeling of an interval-based ABR flow control protocol.

With the inclusion of resource management cell synchronization and consolidation algorithms, this protocol is capable of controlling point-to-multipoint ABR services within a unified framework. The authors illustrate the modeling of single ABR connection, the interaction between multiple ABR connections, and the constraints applicable to flow control decisions.

Survey data from ERP customization clients show that, as hypothesized, clients' trust influenced their perception of engagement success with the company. The data also show that clients' trust in the customization company was increased when the company behaved in accordance with client expectations by being responsive, and decreased when the company behaved in a manner that contradicted these expectations by not being dependable.

The question that this research paper intends to show is: why are males so dominant when it comes to computer related matters? The author has traced this question back to the computer game. Computer games are a fun medium and provide the means for an individual to become computer literate through the engagement of spatial learning and cognitive processing abilities. Since such games are marketed almost exclusively to males, females have a distinct disadvantage. Males are more computer literate through the playing of computer games, and are provided with an easy lead-in to more advanced utilization of computers such as programming.

As deregulation, new technologies, and new competitors open up the mobile telecommunications industry, churn prediction and management has become of great concern to mobile service providers. A mobile service provider wishing to retain its subscribers needs to be able to predict which of them may be at-risk of changing services and will make those subscribers the focus of customer retention efforts. In response to the limitations of existing churn-prediction systems and the unavailability of customer demographics in the mobile telecommunications provider investigated, we propose, design, and experimentally evaluate a churn-prediction technique that predicts churning from subscriber contractual information and call pattern changes extracted from call details. This proposed technique is capable of identifying potential churners at the contract level for a specific prediction time-period. In addition, the proposed technique incorporates the multi-classifier class-combiner approach to address the challenge of a highly skewed class distribution between churners and non-churners. The empirical evaluation results suggest that the proposed call-behavior-based churn-prediction technique exhibits satisfactory predictive effectiveness when more recent call details are employed for the churn prediction model construction. Furthermore, the proposed technique is able to demonstrate satisfactory or reasonable predictive power within the one-month interval between model construction and churn prediction.

This editorial preface investigates current developments in mobile commerce (M-commerce) and proposes an integrated architecture that supports business and consumer needs in an optimal way to successfully implement M-commerce business processes.

As a result, a pull as opposed to a push approach becomes a necessary requirement to conduct M-commerce. In addition, M-commerce has to rely on local, regional, demographic and many other variables to be truly effective. Both observations necessitate an M-commerce architecture that allows the coherent integration of enterprise-level systems as well as the aggregation of product and service offerings from many different and partially competing parties into a collaborative M-commerce platform.

A cardiologist was available 24 h a day for an interactive teleconsultation. In a 13 month period there were 5073 calls to the telecardiology service and 952 subjects with chest pain were identified. The telecardiology service allowed the general practitioners to manage 700 cases (74%) themselves; further diagnostic tests were requested for 162 patients (17%) and 83 patients (9%) were sent to the hospital emergency department. In the last group a cardiological diagnosis was confirmed in 60 patients and refuted in 23. Seven patients in whom the telecardiology service failed to detect a cardiac problem were hospitalized in the subsequent 48 h. The telecardiology service showed a sensitivity of 97.4%, a specificity of 89.5% and a diagnostic accuracy of 86.9% for chest pain.

Personalization generally refers to making a Web site more responsive to the unique and individual needs of each user. We argue that for personalization to work effectively, detailed and interoperable user profiles should be globally available for authorized sites, and these profiles should dynamically reflect changes in user interests. Creating user profiles from user click-stream data seems to be an effective way of generating detailed and dynamic user profiles. However, a user profile generated in this way is available only on the computer where the user accesses his browser, and is inaccessible when the same user works on a different computer. On the other hand, integration of the Internet with telecommunication networks has made it possible for the users to connect to the Web with a variety of mobile devices as well as desktops. This requires that user profiles should be available to any desktop or mobile device on the Internet that users choose to work with. In this paper, we address these problems through the concept of \"trusted authority\". A user agent at the client side that captures the user click stream, dynamically generates a navigational history 'log' file in Extensible Markup Language (XML). This log file is then used to produce 'user profiles' in a resource description framework (RDF). A user's right to privacy is provided through the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) standard.

We propose a unified approach for integrating implicit and explicit knowledge in neurosymbolic systems as a combination of neural and neuro-fuzzy modules. In the developed hybrid system, a training data set is used for building neuro-fuzzy modules, and represents implicit domain knowledge. The explicit domain knowledge on the other hand is represented by fuzzy rules, which are directly mapped into equivalent neural structures. The aim of this approach is to improve the abilities of modular neural structures, which are based on incomplete learning data sets, since the knowledge acquired from human experts is taken into account for adapting the general neural architecture. Three methods to combine the explicit and implicit knowledge modules are proposed. The techniques used to extract fuzzy rules from neural implicit knowledge modules are described. These techniques improve the structure and the behavior of the entire system. The proposed methodology has been applied in the field of air quality prediction with very encouraging results. These experiments show that the method is worth further investigation", "1752": "Non-nested multi-level solvers for finite element discretisations of mixed problems. We consider a general framework for analysing the convergence of multi-grid solvers applied to finite element discretisations of mixed problems, both of conforming and nonconforming type.

Thus, in our multi-level approach, accurate higher order finite element discretisations can be combined with fast multi-level solvers based on lower order (nonconforming) finite element discretisations. This leads to the design of efficient multi-level solvers for higher order finite element discretisations", "183": "Asymptotic analysis of (3, 2, 1)-Shell Sort.

The proposed input current waveform includes the harmonic components which are in phase with the receiving-end voltage harmonics.

A laboratory study was conducted to determine the effects of work pace on typing force, electromyographic (EMG) activity, and subjective discomfort. We found that as participants typed faster, their typing force and finger flexor and extensor EMG activity increased linearly. There was also an increase in subjective discomfort, with a sharp threshold between participants' self-selected pace and their maximum typing speed. The results suggest that participants self-select a typing pace that maximizes typing speed and minimizes discomfort. The fastest typists did not produce significantly more finger flexor EMG activity but did produce proportionately less finger extensor EMG activity compared with the slower typists. We hypothesize that fast typists may use different muscle recruitment patterns that allow them to be more efficient than slower typists at striking the keys. In addition, faster typists do not experience more discomfort than slow typists. These findings show that the relative pace of typing is more important than actual typing speed with regard to discomfort and muscle activity. These results suggest that typists may benefit from skill training to increase maximum typing speed. Potential applications of this research includes skill training for typists", "1649": "Office essentials [stationery suppliers].

We develop an efficient way of representing the geometry and topology of volumetric datasets of biological structures from medium to low resolution, aiming at storing and querying them in a database framework. We make use of a new vector quantization algorithm to select the points within the macromolecule that best approximate the probability density function of the original volume data. Connectivity among points is obtained with the use of the alpha shapes theory. This novel data representation has a number of interesting characteristics, such as (1) it allows us to automatically segment and quantify a number of important structural features from low-resolution maps, such as cavities and channels, opening the possibility of querying large collections of maps on the basis of these quantitative structural features; (2) it provides a compact representation in terms of size; (3) it contains a subset of three-dimensional points that optimally quantify the densities of medium resolution data; and (4) a general model of the geometry and topology of the macromolecule (as opposite to a spatially unrelated bunch of voxels) is easily obtained by the use of the alpha shapes theory", "1893": "Closed-loop model set validation under a stochastic framework.

A necessary and sufficient condition has been derived for the consistency of the model set with both the stabilizing controller and closed-loop frequency domain experimental data (FDED). In this condition, only the Euclidean norm of a complex vector is involved, and this complex vector depends linearly on both the disturbances and the measurement errors. Based on this condition, an analytic formula has been derived for the sample unfalsified probability (SUP) of the model set. Some of the asymptotic statistical properties of the SUP have also been briefly discussed.

This paper's goal is to give a specification language for properties that fits LUML; LUML includes states, actions and real time. ATCTL extends CTL with concurrent actions and real time. It is based on earlier extensions of CTL by R. De Nicola and F. Vaandrager (ACTL) (1990) and R. Alur et aL (TCTL) (1993). This makes it easier to adapt existing model checkers to ATCTL.

These p-phase sequences, with p prime, also have prime length L, and can be constructed from the index sequence of length L or, equivalently, from the cosets of pth power residues and non-residues modulo-L. The linear complexity of these polyphase sequences is derived and shown to fall into four classes depending on the value assigned to b/sub 0/, the initial digit of the sequence, and on whether p belongs to the set of pth power residues or not. The characteristic polynomials of the linear feedback shift registers that generate these sequences are also derived", "1805": "Exact analytical model for the AEP of control signals.

The use of the modified data probe eliminates the ambiguity introduced by the high-impedance state and at the same time retains the same signature of the binary stream. The model specifies algebraically the effects of the TICM architecture, the test pattern length, and the control stream error probabilities. It is proved that the (hardware) criterion used for calculating the AEP for the internal- and external exclusive-OR two-input shift registers is not valid for the general case and a new criterion is provided.

Given this need, the paucity of research papers related to planning, and in particular, optimized planning is surprising. This research, which is aimed at this gap, brings out an application of optimization for the planning of reusable software components (SCs). We present a model that selects a set of SCs that must be built, in order to lower development and adaptation costs.

This paper presents an integrated robust fault detection and isolation (FDI) and fault tolerant control (FTC) scheme for a fault in actuators or sensors of linear stochastic systems subjected to unknown inputs (disturbances). As usual in this kind of works, it is assumed that single fault occurs at a time and the fault treated is of random bias type. The FDI module is constructed using banks of robust two-stage Kalman filters, which simultaneously estimate the state and the fault bias, and generate residual sets decoupled from unknown disturbances. All elements of residual sets are evaluated by using a hypothesis statistical test, and the fault is declared according to the prepared decision logic. The FTC module is activated based on the fault indicator, and additive compensation signal is computed using the fault bias estimate and combined to the nominal control law for compensating the fault's effect on the system.

A relaxation iteration scheme is proposed by making use of a model structure in which the error is bilinear-in-parameters. This leads to a simple algorithm which minimizes the original loss function.

A new class of dynamical systems, Quantized State Systems or QSS, is introduced in this paper.

It is shown that QSS can be exactly represented and simulated by a discrete event model, within the framework of the DEVS-approach. Further, it is shown that QSS can be used to approximate continuous systems, thus allowing their discrete-event simulation in opposition to the classical discrete-time simulation. It is also shown that in an approximating QSS, some stability properties of the original system are conserved and the solutions of the QSS go to the solutions of the original system when the quantization goes to zero", "1488": "Social presence in telemedicine.

We consider an optimal control problem for systems governed by ordinary differential equations with control constraints. Since no convexity assumptions are made on the data, the problem is reformulated in relaxed form. The relaxed state equation is discretized by the implicit trapezoidal scheme and the relaxed controls are approximated by piecewise constant relaxed controls. We then propose a combined descent and discretization method that generates sequences of discrete relaxed controls and progressively refines the discretization. Since here the adjoint of the discrete state equation is not defined, we use, at each iteration, an approximate derivative of the cost functional defined by discretizing the continuous adjoint equation and the integral involved by appropriate trapezoidal schemes. It is proved that accumulation points of sequences constructed by this method satisfy the strong relaxed necessary conditions for optimality for the continuous problem.

The quantitative estimation of regional cardiac deformation from three-dimensional (3-D) image sequences has important clinical implications for the assessment of viability in the heart wall. We present here a generic methodology for estimating soft tissue deformation which integrates image-derived information with biomechanical models, and apply it to the problem of cardiac deformation estimation. The method is image modality independent. The images are segmented interactively and then initial correspondence is established using a shape-tracking approach. A dense motion field is then estimated using a transversely isotropic, linear-elastic model, which accounts for the muscle fiber directions in the left ventricle. The dense motion field is in turn used to calculate the deformation of the heart wall in terms of strain in cardiac specific directions. The strains obtained using this approach in open-chest dogs before and after coronary occlusion, exhibit a high correlation with strains produced in the same animals using implanted markers. Further, they show good agreement with previously published results in the literature. This proposed method provides quantitative regional 3-D estimates of heart deformation", "1777": "Midlife career choices: how are they different from other career choices?.

For the minimization function f, two sufficient conditions exist that ensure the uniqueness of the solution, namely, the concavity of the control polygon of the polynomial and the characteristics of the Polya frequency-control polygon where the minimum coincides with a critical point of the polynomial.

The battle for the copier market is intense, and the popularity of the multifunctional device is going to transform the office equipment market. As total cost of ownership becomes increasingly important and as budgets are squeezed, the most cost-effective solutions are those that will survive this shake-down", "184": "On the expected value of the minimum assignment. The minimum k-assignment of an m*n matrix X is the minimum sum of k entries of X, no two of which belong to the same row or column. Coppersmith and Sorkin conjectured that if X is generated by choosing each entry independently from the exponential distribution with mean 1, then the expected value of its minimum k-assignment is given by an explicit formula, which has been proven only in a few cases. In this paper we describe our efforts to prove the Coppersmith-Sorkin conjecture by considering the more general situation where the entries x/sub ij/ of X are chosen independently from different distributions. In particular, we require that x/sub ij/ be chosen from the exponential distribution with mean 1/r/sub i/c/sub j/. We conjecture an explicit formula for the expected value of the minimum k-assignment of such X and give evidence for this formula", "1652": "Convergence of a finite volume scheme for nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations. One approximates the entropy weak solution u of a nonlinear parabolic degenerate equation u/sub t/+div(qf(u))- Delta phi (u)=0 by a piecewise constant function u/sub D/ using a discretization D in space and time and a finite volume scheme. The convergence of u/sub D/ to u is shown as the size of the space and time steps tend to zero. In a first step, estimates on u/sub D/ are used to prove the convergence, up to a subsequence, of u/sub D/ to a measure valued entropy solution (called here an entropy process solution). A result of uniqueness of the entropy process solution is proved, yielding the strong convergence of u/sub D/ to u. Some numerical results on a model equation are shown", "1738": "Nurture the geek in you [accounting on the Internet]. When chartered accountants focus on IT, it's not simply because we think technology is neat. We keep on top of tech trends and issues because it helps us do our jobs well. We need to know how to best manage and implement the wealth of technology systems within out client base or employer, as well as to determine on an ongoing basis how evolving technologies might affect business strategies, threats and opportunities. One way to stay current with technology is by monitoring the online drumbeat. Imagine the Internet as an endless conversation of millions of chattering voices, each focusing on a multitude of topics and issues. It's not surprising that a great deal of the information relates to technology itself, and if you learn how to tune in to the drumbeat, you can keep yourself informed", "1630": "Digital-domain self-calibration technique for video-rate pipeline A/D converters using Gaussian white noise.

Many CEO and managers understand the importance of knowledge sharing among their employees and are eager to introduce the knowledge management paradigm in their organizations. However little is known about the determinants of the individual's knowledge sharing behavior. The purpose of this study is to develop an understanding of the factors affecting the individual's knowledge sharing behavior in the organizational context. The research model includes various constructs based on social exchange theory, self-efficacy, and theory of reasoned action. Research results from the field survey of 467 employees of four large, public organizations show that expected associations and contribution are the major determinants of the individual's attitude toward knowledge sharing. Expected rewards, believed by many to be the most important motivating factor for knowledge sharing, are not significantly related to the attitude toward knowledge sharing. As expected, positive attitude toward knowledge sharing is found to lead to positive intention to share knowledge and, finally, to actual knowledge sharing behaviors", "169": "MRP in a job shop environment using a resource constrained project scheduling model. One of the most difficult tasks in a job shop manufacturing environment is to balance schedule and capacity in an ongoing basis. MRP systems are commonly used for scheduling, although their inability to deal with capacity constraints adequately is a severe drawback. In this study, we show that material requirements planning can be done more effectively in a job shop environment using a resource constrained project scheduling model. The proposed model augments MRP models by incorporating capacity constraints and using variable lead time lengths. The efficacy of this approach is tested on MRP systems by comparing the inventory carrying costs and resource allocation of the solutions obtained by the proposed model to those obtained by using a traditional MRP model. In general, it is concluded that the proposed model provides improved schedules with considerable reductions in inventory carrying costs", "1732": "Community spirit.

With the spreading of the Internet and the wide use of computers, electronic publishing is becoming an indispensable measure to gain knowledge and skills. Meanwhile, copyright is facing much more infringement than ever in this electronic environment. So, it is a key factor to effectively protect copyright of electronic publishing to foster the new publication fields.

Traditional quantitative coronary angiography is performed on two-dimensional (2-D) projection views. These views are chosen by the angiographer to minimize vessel overlap and foreshortening. With 2-D projection views that are acquired in this nonstandardized fashion, however, there is no way to know or estimate how much error occurs in the QCA process. Furthermore, coronary arteries possess a curvilinear shape and undergo a cyclical deformation due to their attachment to the myocardium. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain three-dimensional (3-D) information to best describe and quantify the dynamic curvilinear nature of the human coronary artery. Using a patient-specific 3-D coronary reconstruction algorithm and routine angiographic images, a new technique is proposed to describe: (1) the curvilinear nature of 3-D coronary arteries and intracoronary devices; (2) the magnitude of the arterial deformation caused by intracoronary devices and due to heart motion; and (3) optimal view(s) with respect to the desired \"pathway\" for delivering intracoronary devices", "1795": "New voice over Internet protocol technique with hierarchical data security protection. The authors propose a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) technique with a new hierarchical data security protection (HDSP) scheme. The proposed HDSP scheme can maintain the voice quality degraded from packet loss and preserve high data security. It performs both the data inter-leaving on the inter-frame of voice for achieving better error recovery of voices suffering from continuous packet loss, and the data encryption on the intra-frame of voice for achieving high data security, which are controlled by a random bit-string sequence generated from a chaotic system. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed HDSP scheme, we have successfully verified and analysed the proposed approach through software simulation and statistical measures on several test voices", "1863": "Information systems project failure: a comparative study of two countries. Many organizations, regardless of size, engage in at least one, and often many information system projects each year. Many of these projects consume massive amounts of resources, and may cost as little as a few thousand dollars to ten, and even hundreds of millions of dollars. Needless to say, the investment of time and resources into these ventures are of significant concern to chief information officers (CIOs), executives staff members, project managers, and others in leadership positions.

The problem of adaptive decentralized stabilization for a class of linear time-invarying large-scale systems with nonlinear interconnectivity and uncertainties is discussed. The bounds of uncertainties are assumed to be unknown. For such uncertain dynamic systems, an adaptive decentralized controller is presented. The resulting closed-loop systems are asymptotically stable in theory. Moreover, an adaptive decentralized control scheme is given. The scheme ensures the closed-loop systems exponentially practically stable and can be used in practical engineering.

This paper presents a new kind of uniform splines, called hyperbolic polynomial B-splines, generated over the space Omega =span{sinh t, cosh t, t/sup k-3/, t/sup k-3/, t/sup k-4/, ..., t 1} in which k is an arbitrary integer larger than or equal to 3. Hyperbolic polynomial B-splines share most of the properties of B-splines in polynomial space. We give subdivision formulae for this new kind of curve and then prove that they have variation diminishing properties and the control polygons of the subdivisions converge. Hyperbolic polynomial B-splines can handle freeform curves as well as remarkable curves such as the hyperbola and the catenary. The generation of tensor product surfaces using these new splines is straightforward. Examples of such tensor product surfaces: the saddle surface, the catenary cylinder, and a certain kind of ruled surface are given", "1733": "Computing grid unlocks research. Under the UK government's spending review in 2000 the Office of Science and Technology was allocated Pounds 98m to establish a three year e-science research and development programme. The programme has a bold vision: to change the dynamic of the way science is undertaken. The term 'e-science' was introduced by John Taylor, director general of research councils in the Office of Science and Technology. He saw many areas of science becoming increasingly reliant on new ways of collaborative, multidisciplinary, interorganisation working. E-science is intended to capture these new modes of working. There are two major components to the programme: the science, and the infrastructure to support that science. The infrastructure is generally referred to as the Grid. The choice of name resonates with the idea of a future in which computing resources and storage, as well as expensive scientific facilities and software, can be accessed on demand, like electricity.

The paper presents a nonlinear adaptive controller (NAC) for single-input single-output feedback linearisable nonlinear systems. A sliding-mode state and perturbation observer is designed to estimate the system states and perturbation which includes the combined effect of system nonlinearities, uncertainties and external disturbances. The NAC design does not require the details of the nonlinear system model and full system states. It possesses an adaptation capability to deal with system parameter uncertainties, unmodelled system dynamics and external disturbances. The convergence of the observer and the stability analysis of the controller/observer system are given.

In this paper, we consider the finite element approximations of a recently proposed Ginzburg-Landau-type model for d-wave superconductors. In contrast to the conventional Ginzburg-Landau model the scalar complex valued order-parameter is replaced by a multicomponent complex order-parameter and the free energy is modified according to the d-wave paring symmetry. Convergence and optimal error estimates and some super-convergent estimates for the derivatives are derived.

For different levels of user performance, different types of information are processed and users will make different types of errors. Based on the error's immediate cause and the information being processed, usability problems can be classified into three categories. They are usability problems associated with skill-based, rule-based and knowledge-based levels of performance. In this paper, a user interface for a Web-based software program was evaluated with two usability evaluation methods, user testing and heuristic evaluation. The experiment discovered that the heuristic evaluation with human factor experts is more effective than user testing in identifying usability problems associated with skill-based and rule-based levels of performance. User testing is more effective than heuristic evaluation in finding usability problems associated with the knowledge-based level of performance.

The matrix forms for curves and surfaces were largely promoted in CAD/CAM. In this paper we have presented two matrix representation formulations for arbitrary degree NURBS curves and surfaces explicitly other than recursively.

A three-dimensional (3D) lumped-parameter model of a powered wheelchair was created to aid the development of the Rocket prototype wheelchair and to help explore the effect of innovative design features on its stability. The model was developed using simulation software, specifically Working Model 3D. The accuracy of the model was determined by comparing both its static stability angles and dynamic behavior as it passed down a 4.8-cm (1.9\") road curb at a heading of 45 degrees with the performance of the actual wheelchair. The model's predictions of the static stability angles in the forward, rearward, and lateral directions were within 9.3, 7.1, and 3.8% of the measured values, respectively. The average absolute error in the predicted position of the wheelchair as it moved down the curb was 2.2 cm/m (0.9\" per 3'3\") traveled. The accuracy was limited by the inability to model soft bodies, the inherent difficulties in modeling a statically indeterminate system, and the computing time. Nevertheless, it was found to be useful in investigating the effect of eight design alterations on the lateral stability of the wheelchair. Stability was quantified by determining the static lateral stability angles and the maximum height of a road curb over which the wheelchair could successfully drive on a diagonal heading. The model predicted that the stability was more dependent on the configuration of the suspension system than on the dimensions and weight distribution of the wheelchair. Furthermore, for the situations and design alterations studied, predicted improvements in static stability were not correlated with improvements in dynamic stability", "1506": "Intelligent control of life support for space missions. Future manned space operations will include a greater use of automation than we currently see. For example, semiautonomous robots and software agents will perform difficult tasks while operating unattended most of the time.

An elliptic curve is a pair (E, O), where E is a smooth projective curve of genus 1 and O is a point of E, called the point at infinity.

E is said to be defined over Q if the coefficients a/sub i/, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are rationals and O is defined over Q. Let E/Q be an elliptic curve and let E(Q)/sub tors/ be the torsion group of points of E defined over Q. The theorem of Mazur asserts that E(Q)/sub tors/ is one of the following 15 groups E(Q)/sub tors/ {Z/mZ, Z/mZ * Z/2mZ, m, = 1, 2, ..., 10, 12, m = 1, 2, 3, 4. We say that an elliptic curve E'/Q is isogenous to the elliptic curve E if there is an isogeny, i.e. a morphism phi : E to E' such that phi (O) = O, where O is the point at infinity. We give an explicit model of all elliptic curves for which E(Q)/sub tors/ is in the form Z/mZ where m = 9,10,12 or Z/2Z * Z/2mZ where m = 4, according to Mazur's theorem. Moreover, for every family of such elliptic curves, we give an explicit model of all their isogenous curves with cyclic kernels consisting of rational points", "1600": "The development and evaluation of a fuzzy logic expert system for renal transplantation assignment: Is this a useful tool?. Allocating donor kidneys to patients is a complex, multicriteria decision-making problem which involves not only medical, but also ethical and political issues. In this paper, a fuzzy logic expert system approach was proposed as an innovative way to deal with the vagueness and complexity faced by medical doctors in kidney allocation decision making. A pilot fuzzy logic expert system for kidney allocation was developed and evaluated in comparison with two existing allocation algorithms: a priority sorting system used by multiple organ retrieval and exchange (MORE) in Canada and a point scoring systems used by united network for organ sharing (UNOS) in US. Our simulated experiment based on real data indicated that the fuzzy logic system can represent the expert's thinking well in handling complex tradeoffs, and overall, the fuzzy logic derived recommendations were more acceptable to the expert than those from the MORE and UNOS algorithms", "149": "Extending Kamp's theorem to model time granularity. In this paper, a generalization of Kamp's theorem relative to the functional completeness of the until operator is proved. Such a generalization consists in showing the functional completeness of more expressive temporal operators with respect to the extension of the first-order theory of linear orders MFO[<] with an extra binary relational symbol. The result is motivated by the search of a modal language capable of expressing properties and operators suitable to model time granularity in omega -layered temporal structures", "1670": "An integrated optimization model for train crew management. Train crew management involves the development of a duty timetable for each of the drivers (crew) to cover a given train timetable in a rail transport organization. This duty timetable is spread over a certain period, known as the roster planning horizon. Train crew management may arise either from the planning stage, when the total number of crew and crew distributions are to be determined, or from the operating stage when the number of crew at each depot is known as input data. In this paper, we are interested in train crew management in the planning stage. In the literature, train crew management is decomposed into two stages: crew scheduling and crew rostering which are solved sequentially. We propose an integrated optimization model to solve both crew scheduling and crew rostering. The model enables us to generate either cyclic rosters or non-cyclic rosters. Numerical experiments are carried out over data sets arising from a practical application", "18": "Differential and integral calculus on discrete time series data. It has been found that discontinuity plays a crucial role in natural evolutions (Lin 1998). In this presentation, we will generalize the idea of integration and differentiation, we developed in calculus, to the study of time series in the hope that the problem of outliers and discontinuities can be resolved more successfully than simply deleting the outliers and avoiding discontinuities from the overall data analysis. In general, appearances of outliers tend to mean existence of discontinuities, explosive growth or decline in the evolution. At the same time, our approach can be employed to partially overcome the problem of not having enough data values in any available time series. At the end, we will look at some real-life problems of prediction in order to see the power of this new approach", "1651": "H-matrix approximation for the operator exponential with applications. We previously developed a data-sparse and accurate approximation to parabolic solution operators in the case of a rather general elliptic part given by a strongly P-positive operator . Also a class of matrices (H-matrices) has been analysed which are data-sparse and allow an approximate matrix arithmetic with almost linear complexity. In particular, the matrix-vector/matrix-matrix product with such matrices as well as the computation of the inverse have linear-logarithmic cost. In this paper, we apply the H-matrix techniques to approximate the exponent of an elliptic operator. Starting with the Dunford-Cauchy representation for the operator exponent, we then discretise the integral by the exponentially convergent quadrature rule involving a short sum of resolvents. The latter are approximated by the H-matrices. Our algorithm inherits a two-level parallelism with respect to both the computation of resolvents and the treatment of different time values.

The neural networks are piecewisely interpolated to generate a linear differential inclusion model by which a linear state feedback H/sub infinity / control law can be applied. An adaptive weight adjustment mechanism for the multilayer feedforward neural networks is developed to ensure H/sub infinity / regulation performance. It is shown that finding the control gain matrices can be transformed into a standard linear matrix inequality problem and solved via a developed recurrent neural network", "1605": "A GRASP heuristic for the mixed Chinese postman problem. Arc routing problems (ARPs) consist of finding a traversal on a graph satisfying some conditions related to the links of the graph. In the Chinese postman problem (CPP) the aim is to find a minimum cost tour (closed walk) traversing all the links of the graph at least once. Both the Undirected CPP, where all the links are edges that can be traversed in both ways, and the Directed CPP, where all the links are arcs that must be traversed in a specified way, are known to be polynomially solvable. However, if we deal with a mixed graph (having edges and arcs), the problem turns out to be NP-hard. In this paper, we present a heuristic algorithm for this problem, the so-called Mixed CPP (MCPP), based on greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) techniques. The algorithm has been tested and compared with other known and recent methods from the literature on a wide collection of randomly generated instances, with up to 200 nodes and 600 links, producing encouraging computational results.

We elucidate the connection between Bezier curves in polar coordinates, also called p-Bezier or focal Bezier curves, and certain families of spirals and sectrix curves. p-Bezier curves are the analogue in polar coordinates of nonparametric Bezier curves in Cartesian coordinates. Such curves form a subset of rational Bezier curves characterized by control points on radial directions regularly spaced with respect to the polar angle, and weights equal to the inverse of the polar radius. We show that this subset encompasses several classical sectrix curves, which solve geometrically the problem of dividing an angle into equal spans, and also spirals defining the trajectories of particles in central fields. First, we identify as p-Bezier curves a family of sinusoidal spirals that includes Tschirnhausen's cubic. Second, the trisectrix of Maclaurin and their generalizations, called arachnidas.

Although increases in the use of automation have occurred across society, research has found that human operators often underutilize (disuse) and overly rely on (misuse) automated aids (Parasuraman-Riley (1997)). Nearly 275 Cameron University students participated in 1 of 3 experiments performed to examine the effects of perceived utility (Dzindolet et al. (2001)) on automation use in a visual detection task and to compare reliance on automated aids with reliance on humans. Results revealed a bias for human operators to rely on themselves. Although self-report data indicate a bias toward automated aids over human aids, performance data revealed that participants were more likely to disuse automated aids than to disuse human aids. This discrepancy was accounted for by assuming human operators have a \"perfect automation\" schema.

In particular, we show that the same result as in the case K = 0 (Koto, 1994) holds for this test equation, i.e., every A-stable RK method preserves the delay-independent stability of the exact solution whenever a step-size of the form h = tau /m is used, where m is a positive integer", "1919": "Toward a formalism for conversation protocols using joint intention theory. Conversation protocols are used to achieve certain goals or to bring about certain states in the world. Therefore, one may identify the landmarks or the states that must be brought about during the goal-directed execution of a protocol. Accordingly, the landmarks, characterized by propositions that are true in the state represented by that landmark, are the most important aspect of a protocol. Families of conversation protocols can be expressed formally as partially ordered landmarks after the landmarks necessary to achieve a goal have been identified. Concrete protocols represented as joint action expressions can, then, be derived from the partially ordered landmarks and executed directly by joint intention interpreters. This approach of applying Joint Intention theory to protocols also supports flexibility in the actions used to get to landmarks, shortcutting protocol execution, automatic exception handling, and correctness criterion for protocols and protocol compositions", "1744": "Convergence of Toland's critical points for sequences of DC functions and application to the resolution of semilinear elliptic problems.

The fields of human-computer interaction, interface design, and human factors have made significant contributions to ease of use and are primarily concerned with the interfaces between systems and users, not with the structures that are often more fundamental for designing truly human-centered systems. The emerging paradigm of human-centered computing (HCC)-which has taken many forms-offers a new look at system design. HCC requires more than merely designing an artificial agent to supplement a human agent. The dynamic interactions in a distributed system composed of human and artificial agents-and the context in which the system is situated-are indispensable factors. While we have successfully applied our methodology in designing a prototype of a human-centered intelligent flight-surgeon console at NASA Johnson Space Center, this article presents a methodology for designing human-centered computing systems using electronic medical records (EMR) systems", "1898": "Design of a stroke dependent damper for the front axle suspension of a truck using multibody system dynamics and numerical optimization. A stroke dependent damper is designed for the front axle suspension of a truck. The damper supplies extra damping for inward deflections rising above 4 cm. In this way the damper should reduce extreme suspension deflections without deteriorating the comfort of the truck. But the question is which stroke dependent damping curve yields the best compromise between suspension deflection working space and comfort. Therefore an optimization problem is defined to minimize the maximum inward suspension deflection subject to constraints on the chassis acceleration for three typical road undulations. The optimization problem is solved using sequential linear programming (SLP) and multibody dynamics simulation software. Several optimization runs have been carried out for a small two degree of freedom vehicle model and a large full-scale model of the truck semi-trailer combination. The results show that the stroke dependent damping can reduce large deflections at incidental road disturbances, but that the optimum stroke dependent damping curve is related to the acceleration bound. By means of vehicle model simulation and numerical optimization we have been able to quantify this trade-off between suspension deflection working space and truck comfort", "1797": "Use of periodic and monotonic activation functions in multilayer feedforward neural networks trained by extended Kalman filter algorithm. The authors investigate the convergence and pruning performance of multilayer feedforward neural networks with different types of neuronal activation functions in solving various problems. Three types of activation functions are adopted in the network, namely, the traditional sigmoid function, the sinusoidal function and a periodic function that can be considered as a combination of the first two functions. To speed up the learning, as well as to reduce the network size, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm conjunct with a pruning method is used to train the network. The corresponding networks are applied to solve five typical problems, namely, 4-point XOR logic function, parity generation, handwritten digit recognition, piecewise linear function approximation and sunspot series prediction. Simulation results show that periodic activation functions perform better than monotonic ones in solving multicluster classification problems. Moreover, the combined periodic activation function is found to possess the fast convergence and multicluster classification capabilities of the sinusoidal activation function while keeping the robustness property of the sigmoid function required in the modelling of unknown systems", "1908": "Explicit solutions for transcendental equations. A simple method to formulate an explicit expression for the roots of any analytic transcendental function is presented.

For a two-dimensional heat conduction problem, we consider its initial boundary value problem and the related inverse problem of determining the initial temperature distribution from transient temperature measurements. The conditional stability for this inverse problem and the error analysis for the Tikhonov regularization are presented. An implicit inversion method, which is based on the regularization technique and the successive over-relaxation (SOR) iteration process, is established. Due to the explicit difference scheme for a direct heat problem developed in this paper, the inversion process is very efficient, while the application of SOR technique makes our inversion convergent rapidly. Numerical results illustrating our method are also given", "171": "Education, training and development policies and practices in medium-sized companies in the UK: do they really influence firm performance?. This paper sets out to examine the relationship between training and firm performance in middle-sized UK companies. It recognises that there is evidence that \"high performance work practices\" appear to be associated with better performance in large US companies, but argues that this relationship is less likely to be present in middle-sized companies. The paper's key contribution is to justify the wider concept of education, training and development (ETD) as applicable to such companies. It then finds that clusters of some ETD variables do appear to be associated with better middle-sized company performance", "1696": "Comments on \"Frequency decomposition and computing of ultrasound medical images with wavelet packets\".

World-wide, much attention has been given to cadastral development. As a consequence of experiences made during recent decades, several authors have stated the need for research in the domain of cadastre and proposed methodologies to be used. The paper contributes to the acceptance of research methodologies needed for cadastral development, and thereby enhances theory in the cadastral domain. The paper reviews nine publications on cadastre and identifies the methodologies used. The review focuses on the institutional, social, political and economic aspects of cadastral development, rather than on the technical aspects. The main conclusion is that the methodologies used are largely those of the social sciences. That agrees with the notion that cadastre relates as much to people and institutions, as it relates to land, and that cadastral systems are shaped by social, political and economic conditions, as well as technology. Since the geodetic survey profession has been the keeper of the cadastre, geodetic surveyors will have to deal ever more with social science matters, a fact that universities will have to consider", "1646": "The limits of shape constancy: point-to-point mapping of perspective projections of flat figures. The present experiments investigate point-to-point mapping of perspective transformations of 2D outline figures under diverse viewing conditions: binocular free viewing, monocular perspective with 2D cues masked by an optic tunnel, and stereoptic viewing through an optic tunnel. The first experiment involved upright figures, and served to determine baseline point-to-point mapping accuracy, which was found to be very good. Three shapes were used: square, circle and irregularly round. The main experiment, with slanted figures, involved only two shapes-square and irregularly shaped-showed at several slant degrees. Despite the accumulated evidence for shape constancy when the outline of perspective projections is considered, metric perception of the inner structure of such projections was quite limited. Systematic distortions were found, especially with more extreme slants, and attributed to the joint effect of several factors: anchors, 3D information, and slant underestimation. Contradictory flatness cues did not detract from performance, while stereoptic information improved it", "1535": "Hot controllers. Over the last few years, the semiconductor industry has put much emphasis on ways to improve the accuracy of thermal mass flow controllers (TMFCs). Although issues involving TMFC mounting orientation and pressure effects have received much attention, little has been done to address the effect of changes in ambient temperature or process gas temperature. Scientists and engineers at Qualiflow have succeeded to solve the problem using a temperature correction algorithm for digital TMFCs. Using an in situ environmental temperature compensation technique, we calculated correction factors for the temperature effect and obtained satisfactory results with both the traditional sensor and the new, improved thin-film sensors", "1824": "Parallel operation of capacity-limited three-phase four-wire active power filters. Three-phase four-wire active power filters (APFs) are presented that can be paralleled to enlarge the system capacity and reliability. The APF employs the PWM four-leg voltage-source inverter. A decoupling control approach for the leg connected to the neutral line is proposed such that the switching of all legs has no interaction. Functions of the proposed APF include compensation of reactive power, harmonic current, unbalanced power and zero-sequence current of the load. The objective is to achieve unity power factor, balanced line current and zero neutral-line current. Compensation of all components is capacity-limited, co-operating with the cascaded load current sensing scheme. Multiple APFs can be paralleled to share the load power without requiring any control interconnection. In addition to providing the theoretic bases and detailed design of the APFs, two 6 kVA APFs are implemented. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with experimental results", "1497": "Research challenges and perspectives of the Semantic Web.

Evaluates the effectiveness of a computerized classification method as an aid to radiologists reviewing clinical mammograms for which the diagnoses were unknown to both the radiologists and the computer. Six mammographers and six community radiologists participated in an observer study. These 12 radiologists interpreted, with and without the computer aid, 110 cases that were unknown to both the 12 radiologist observers and the trained computer classification scheme. The radiologists' performances in differentiating between benign and malignant masses without and with the computer aid were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Two-tailed P values were calculated for the Student t test to indicate the statistical significance of the differences in performances with and without the computer aid. When the computer aid was used, the average performance of the 12 radiologists improved, as indicated by an increase in the area under the ROC curve (A/sub z/) from 0.93 to 0.96 (P<.001), by an increase in partial area under the ROC curve (/sub 0.9/0A'/sub z/) from 0.56 to 0.72 (P<.001), and by an increase in sensitivity from 94% to 98% (P=.022). No statistically significant difference in specificity was found between readings with and those without computer aid ( Delta +-0.014; P=.46; 95% Cl: -0.054, 0.026), where Delta is difference in specificity. When we analyzed results from the mammographers and community radiologists as separate groups, a larger improvement was demonstrated for the community radiologists. Computer-aided diagnosis can potentially help radiologists improve their diagnostic accuracy in the task of differentiating between benign and malignant masses seen on mammograms", "1703": "Statistical analysis of nonlinearly reconstructed near-infrared tomographic images. II. Experimental interpretation. For pt. I see ibid., vol. 21, no. 7, p. 755-63 (2002). Image error analysis of a diffuse near-infrared tomography (NIR) system has been carried out on simulated data using a statistical approach described in pt. I of this paper (Pogue et al., 2002). The methodology is used here with experimental data acquired on phantoms with a prototype imaging system intended for characterizing breast tissue. Results show that imaging performance is not limited by random measurement error, but rather by calibration issues. The image error over the entire field of view is generally not minimized when an accurate homogeneous estimate of the phantom properties is available; however, local image error over a target region of interest (ROI) is reduced. The image reconstruction process which includes a Levenberg-Marquardt style regularization provides good minimization of the objective function, yet its reduction is not always correlated with an overall image error decrease. Minimization of the bias in an ROI which contains localized changes in the optical properties can be achieved through five to nine iterations of the algorithm. Precalibration of the algorithm through statistical evaluation of phantom studies may provide a better measure of the image accuracy than that implied by minimization of the standard objective function", "1788": "Resolving Web user on the fly. Identity authentication systems and procedures are rapidly becoming central issues in the practice and study of information systems development and security.

Although the product is primarily targeted to provide a fillip to transactions carried out over the Web, this product can also be effectively used for non-Internet transactions that are carried out where user authentication is required", "1802": "Novel TCP congestion control scheme and its performance evaluation. A novel self-tuning proportional and derivative (ST-PD) control based TCP congestion control scheme is proposed. The new scheme approaches the congestion control problem from a control-theoretical perspective and overcomes several Important limitations associated with existing TCP congestion control schemes, which are heuristic based. In the proposed scheme, a PD controller is employed to keep the buffer occupancy of the bottleneck node on the connection path at an ideal operating level, and it adjusts the TCP window accordingly. The control gains of the PD controller are tuned online by a fuzzy logic controller based on the perceived bandwidth-delay product of the TCP connection. This scheme gives ST-PD TCP several advantages over current TCP implementations. These include rapid response to bandwidth variations, insensitivity to buffer sizes, and significant improvement of TCP throughput over lossy links by decoupling congestion control and error control functions of TCP", "1897": "User-appropriate tyre-modelling for vehicle dynamics in standard and limit situations. When modelling vehicles for the vehicle dynamic simulation, special attention must be paid to the modelling of tyre forces and -torques, according to their dominant influence on the results. This task is not only about sufficiently exact representation of the effective forces but also about user-friendly and practical relevant applicability, especially when the experimental tyre-input-data is incomplete or missing. This text firstly describes the basics of the vehicle dynamic tyre model, conceived to be a physically based, semi-empirical model for application in connection with multi-body-systems (MBS). On the basis of tyres for a passenger car and a heavy truck the simulated steady state tyre characteristics are shown together and compared with the underlying experimental values. The possibility to link the tyre model TMeasy to any MBS-program is described, as far as it supports the 'Standard Tyre Interface'.

Due to inevitable power dissipation, it is said that nano-scaled computing devices should perform their computing processes in a reversible manner. This will be a large problem in constructing three-dimensional nano-scaled functional objects.

It can self-reproduce various patterns in three-dimensional reversible cellular space without dissipating garbage signals", "1899": "Human face detection in visual scenes using neural networks. This paper presents a neural network based face detection system. Our objective is to design a system that can detect human faces in visual scenes at high searching speed and accuracy. We used a neural network with a simple structure but trained using face and non-face samples preprocessed by several methods (position normalization, histogram equalization, etc.) to attain high accuracy, then pruned the size of the neural network so that it could run faster and reduced the total search area of a target visual scene using the skin color detector. Skin color detection assumes that faces reside only in skin color regions. The system design is made up of two parts: the face detecting system that detects the faces, and the searching speed improving system. Speed improvement is achieved by reducing the face locator network size using the structural learning with knowledge and by reducing the face search area using the skin color detection system. Faster training of the neural networks was also achieved using variable step sizes", "1874": "E - a brainiac theorem prover. We describe the superposition-based theorem prover E.

Based on previous research and properties of organizational memory, a conceptual model for navigation and retrieval functions in an intranet portal organizational memory information system was proposed, and two human-centred features (memory structure map and history-based tool) were developed to support user's navigation and retrieval in a well-known organizational memory. To test two hypotheses concerning the validity of the conceptual model and two human-centred features, an experiment was conducted with 30 subjects. Testing of the two hypotheses indicated the following: (1) the memory structure map's users showed 29% better performance in navigation, and (2) the history-based tool's users outperformed by 34% in identifying information. The results of the study suggest that a conceptual model and two human-centred features could be used in a user-adaptive interface design to improve user's performance in an intranet portal organizational memory information system", "160": "Taming the paper tiger [paperwork organization].

Making the content of contracts persistent is achieved by reconstructing contract templates by means of mereologic (logic of the whole-part relation). Possibly nested sub-structures of the contract template are taken as a basis for negotiation in a dialogical way.

We compare the variance of two estimated models. The first one is estimated directly from data and the other one is computed by reducing a high order model, by L/sub 2/ model reduction. In the FIR case we show that it is never better to estimate the model directly from data, compared to estimating it via L/sub 2/ model reduction of a high order FIR model. For OE models we show that the reduced model has the same variance as the directly estimated one if the reduced model class used contains the true system", "1644": "An experimental evaluation of comprehensibility aspects of knowledge structures derived through induction techniques: a case study of industrial fault diagnosis. Machine induction has been extensively used in order to develop knowledge bases for decision support systems and predictive systems. The extent to which developers and domain experts can comprehend these knowledge structures and gain useful insights into the basis of decision making has become a challenging research issue. This article examines the knowledge structures generated by the C4.5 induction technique in a fault diagnostic task and proposes to use a model of human learning in order to guide the process of making comprehensive the results of machine induction. The model of learning is used to generate hierarchical representations of diagnostic knowledge by adjusting the level of abstraction and varying the goal structures between 'shallow' and 'deep' ones. Comprehensibility is assessed in a global way in an experimental comparison where subjects are required to acquire the knowledge structures and transfer to new tasks. This method of addressing the issue of comprehensibility appears promising especially for machine induction techniques that are rather inflexible with regard to the number and sorts of interventions allowed to system developers", "1902": "Engineering plug-in software components to support collaborative work. Many software applications require co-operative work support, including collaborative editing, group awareness, versioning, messaging and automated notification and co-ordination agents.

We describe our recent work in seamlessly adding such capabilities to component-based applications via a set of collaborative work-supporting plug-in software components. We describe a variety of applications of this technique, along with descriptions of the novel architecture, user interface adaptation and implementation techniques for the collaborative work-supporting components that we have developed. We report on our experiences to date with this method of supporting collaborative work enhancement of component-based systems, and discuss the advantages of our approach over conventional techniques", "1713": "A uniform framework for regulating service access and information release on the Web. The widespread use of Internet-based services is increasing the amount of information (such as user profiles) that clients are required to disclose. This information demand is necessary for regulating access to services, and functionally convenient (e.g., to support service customization), but it has raised privacy-related concerns which, if not addressed, may affect the users disposition to use network services. At the same time, servers need to regulate service access without disclosing entirely the details of their access control policy. There is therefore a pressing need for privacy-aware techniques to regulate access to services open to the network. We propose an approach for regulating service access and information disclosure on the Web. The approach consists of a uniform formal framework to formulate - and reason about - both service access and information disclosure constraints. It also provides a means for parties to communicate their requirements while ensuring that no private information be disclosed and that the communicated requirements are correct with respect to the constraints", "1551": "The numerical solution of an evolution problem of second order in time on a closed smooth boundary. We consider an initial value problem for the second-order differential equation with a Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator coefficient. For the numerical solution we carry out semi-discretization by the Laguerre transformation with respect to the time variable. Then an infinite system of the stationary operator equations is obtained. By potential theory, the operator equations are reduced to boundary integral equations of the second kind with logarithmic or hypersingular kernels. The full discretization is realized by Nystrom's method which is based on the trigonometric quadrature rules. Numerical tests confirm the ability of the method to solve these types of nonstationary problems", "1571": "The simulated emergence of distributed environmental control in evolving microcosms. This work continues investigation into Gaia theory (Lovelock, The ages of Gaia, Oxford University Press, 1995) from an artificial life perspective (Downing, Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Artificial Life, p. 90-99, MIT Press, 2000), with the aim of assessing the general compatibility of emergent distributed environmental control with conventional natural selection. Our earlier system, GUILD (Downing and Zvirinsky, Artificial Life, 5, p.291-318, 1999), displayed emergent regulation of the chemical environment by a population of metabolizing agents, but the chemical model underlying those results was trivial, essentially admitting all possible reactions at a single energy cost. The new model, METAMIC, utilizes abstract chemistries that are both (a) constrained to a small set of legal reactions, and (b) grounded in basic fundamental relationships between energy, entropy, and biomass synthesis/breakdown. To explore the general phenomena of emergent homeostasis, we generate 100 different chemistries and use each as the basis for several METAMIC runs, as part of a Gaia hunt. This search discovers 20 chemistries that support microbial populations capable of regulating a physical environmental factor within their growth-optimal range, despite the extra metabolic cost. Case studies from the Gaia hunt illustrate a few simple mechanisms by which real biota might exploit the underlying chemistry to achieve some control over their physical environment. Although these results shed little light on the question of Gaia on Earth, they support the possibility of emergent environmental control at the microcosmic level", "1671": "Cane railway scheduling via constraint logic programming: labelling order and constraints in a real-life application. In Australia, cane transport is the largest unit cost in the manufacturing of raw sugar, making up around 35% of the total manufacturing costs.

The paper presents a study using constraint logic programming (CLP) to solve the cane transport scheduling problem. Tailored heuristic labelling order and constraints strategies are proposed and encouraging results of application to several test problems and one real-life case are presented. The preliminary results demonstrate that CLP can be used as an effective tool for solving the cane transport scheduling problem, with a potential decrease in development costs of the scheduling system.

Uses artificial intelligence methods to determine whether quantitative parameters describing the perfusion image can be synthesized to make a reasonable estimate of the pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure measured at angiography. Radionuclide perfusion images were obtained in 120 patients with normal chest radiographs who also underwent angiographic PA pressure measurement within 3 days of the radionuclide study. An artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed from several image parameters describing statistical and boundary characteristics of the perfusion images. With use of a leave-one-out cross-validation technique, this method was used to predict the PA systolic pressure in cases on which the ANN had not been trained. A Pearson correlation coefficient was determined between the predicted and measured PA systolic pressures. ANN predictions correlated with measured pulmonary systolic pressures (r=0.846, P<.001). The accuracy of the predictions was not influenced by the presence of pulmonary embolism. None of the 51 patients with predicted PA pressures of less than 29 mm Hg had pulmonary hypertension at angiography. All 13 patients with predicted PA pressures greater than 48 mm Hg had pulmonary hypertension at angiography. Meaningful information regarding PA pressure can be derived from noninvasive radionuclide perfusion scanning.

Such eigenfeatures are ideal features for finely locating fields efficiently. The eigenfeatures are extracted from a set of the positive and negative training samples for facial features and are used to train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) whose output indicates the degree to which a particular image window contains the eyes or the mouth within itself.

Pressured by the growing need for fast response times, mass customization, and globalization, many organizations are turning to flexible organizational forms, such as virtual teams.

Virtual teams require their members to rely heavily on the use of information technology and trust in coworkers. This study investigates the impacts that the reliance on information technology (operationalized in our study via the user satisfaction construct) and trust have on the job satisfaction of virtual team members. The study findings reveal that both user satisfaction and trust are positively related to job satisfaction in virtual teams, while system use was not found to play a significant role.

Moreover, because the Web makes it so easy to take surveys and solicit comments, companies are finding themselves inundated with data from questionnaires and other sources. Handling it all manually would be not only cumbersome but also costly. Thus, devising a computer system that can automatically mine useful information from open answers has become an important issue.

Viral messages underlie certain principles: (1) prospects and customers of the idea are offered a technology platform providing a possibility to send a message to a majority of persons; (2) there is an emotional or pecuniary incentive to participate. Ideally, niches of needs and market vacua are filled with funny ideas; (3) also, the recipients are facing emotional or pecuniary incentives to contact a majority of further recipients - this induces a snowball effect and the message is spread virally; and (4) the customer is activated as an \"ambassador\" of the piece of information, for instance promoting a product or a company.

Recent models of natural language processing employ statistical reasoning for dealing with the ambiguity of formal grammars. In this approach, statistics, concerning the various linguistic phenomena of interest, are gathered from actual linguistic data and used to estimate the probabilities of the various entities that are generated by a given grammar, e.g., derivations, parse-trees and sentences. The extension of grammars with probabilities makes it possible to state ambiguity resolution as a constrained optimization formula, which aims at maximizing the probability of some entity that the grammar generates given the input (e.g., maximum probability parse-tree given some input sentence). The implementation of these optimization formulae in efficient algorithms, however, does not always proceed smoothly. In this paper, we address the computational complexity of ambiguity resolution under various kinds of probabilistic models. We provide proofs that some, frequently occurring problems of ambiguity resolution are NP-complete. These problems are encountered in various applications, e.g., language understanding for textand speech-based applications. Assuming the common model of computation, this result implies that, for many existing probabilistic models it is not possible to devise tractable algorithms for solving these optimization problems", "1772": "The effects of technology on midcareer librarians.

However, the road to riches could have easily become the road to ruin had the retailer not exerted control over its inventory management", "1909": "Breast MR imaging with high spectral and spatial resolutions: preliminary experience. The authors evaluated magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with high spectral and spatial resolutions (HSSR) of water and fat in breasts of healthy volunteers (n=6) and women with suspicious lesions (n=6). Fat suppression, edge delineation, and image texture were improved on MR images derived from HSSR data compared with those on conventional MR images. HSSR MR imaging data acquired before and after contrast medium injection showed spectrally inhomogeneous changes in the water resonances in small voxels that were not detectable with conventional MR imaging", "1815": "Control of integral processes with dead-time. 1. Disturbance observer-based 2 DOF control scheme. A disturbance observer-based control scheme (a version of 2 DOF internal model control) which is very effective in controlling integral processes with dead time is presented. The controller can be designed to reject ramp disturbances as well as step disturbances and even arbitrary disturbances. When the plant model is available only two parameters are left to tune. One is the time constant of the set-point response and the other is the time constant of the disturbance response. The latter is tuned according to the compromise between disturbance response and robustness. This control scheme has a simple, clear, easy-to-design, easy-to-implement structure and good performance. It is compared to the best results (so far) using some simulation examples", "1635": "Simple...But complex. FlexPro 5.0, from Weisang and Co., is one of those products which aim to serve an often ignored range of data users: those who, in FlexPro's words, are interested in documenting, analysing and archiving data in the simplest way possible. The online help system is clearly designed to promote the product in this market segment, with a very clear introduction from first principles and a hands-on tutorial, and the live project to which it was applied was selected with this in mind", "1543": "RISCy business. Part 1: RISC projects by Cornell students. The author looks at several projects that Cornell University students entered in the Atmel Design 2001 contest. Those covered include a vertical plotter; BiLines, an electronic game; a wireless Internet pager; Cooking Coach; Barbie's zip drive; and a model train controller", "1606": "Single machine earliness-tardiness scheduling with resource-dependent release dates. This paper deals with the single machine earliness and tardiness scheduling problem with a common due date and resource-dependent release dates. It is assumed that the cost of resource consumption of a job is a non-increasing linear function of the job release date, and this function is common for all jobs. The objective is to find a schedule and job release dates that minimize the total resource consumption, and earliness and tardiness penalties. It is shown that the problem is NP-hard in the ordinary sense even if the due date is unrestricted (the number of jobs that can be scheduled before the due date is unrestricted). An exact dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for small and medium size problems is developed. A heuristic algorithm for large-scale problems is also proposed and the results of a computational comparison between heuristic and optimal solutions are discussed", "1737": "The road to recovery [disaster planning]. September 11 stripped us of our innocence, forcing corporations to recognize that disaster planning is a business necessity", "1523": "Process specialization: defining specialization for state diagrams. A precise definition of specialization and inheritance promises to be as useful in organizational process modeling as it is in object modeling. It would help us better understand, maintain, reuse, and generate process models. However, even though object-oriented analysis and design methodologies take full advantage of the object specialization hierarchy, the process specialization hierarchy is not supported in major process representations, such as the state diagram, data flow diagram, and UML representations. Partly underlying this lack of support is an implicit assumption that we can always specialize a process by treating it as \"just another object.\" We argue in this paper that this is not so straightforward as it might seem; we argue that a process-specific approach must be developed. We propose such an approach in the form of a set of transformations which, when applied to a process description, always result in specialization. We illustrate this approach by applying it to the state diagram representation and demonstrate that this approach to process specialization is not only theoretically possible, but shows promise as a method for categorizing and analyzing processes. We point out apparent inconsistencies between our notion of process specialization and existing work on object specialization but show that these inconsistencies are superficial and that the definition we provide is compatible with the traditional notion of specialization"}
