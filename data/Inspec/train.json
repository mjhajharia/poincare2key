{"1213": "A knowledge intensive multi-agent framework for cooperative/collaborative design modeling and decision support of assemblies. Multi-agent modeling has emerged as a promising discipline for dealing with the decision making process in distributed information system applications. One of such applications is the modeling of distributed design or manufacturing processes which can link up various designs or manufacturing processes to form a virtual consortium on a global basis. This paper proposes a novel knowledge intensive multi-agent cooperative/collaborative framework for concurrent intelligent design and assembly planning, which integrates product design, design for assembly, assembly planning, assembly system design, and assembly simulation subjected to econo-technical evaluations. An AI protocol based method is proposed to facilitate the integration of intelligent agents for assembly design, planning, evaluation and simulation processes. A unified class of knowledge intensive Petri nets is defined using the OO knowledge-based Petri net approach and used as an AI protocol for handling both the integration and the negotiation problems among multi-agents. The detailed cooperative/collaborative mechanism and algorithms are given based on the knowledge object cooperation formalisms. As such, the assembly-oriented design system can easily be implemented under the multi-agent-based knowledge-intensive Petri net framework with concurrent integration of multiple cooperative knowledge sources and software. Thus, product design and assembly planning can be carried out simultaneously and intelligently in an entirely computer-aided concurrent design and assembly planning system", "1024": "Rational systems exhibit moderate risk aversion with respect to \"gambles\" on variable-resolution compression. In an embedded wavelet scheme for progressive transmission, a tree structure naturally defines the spatial relationship on the hierarchical pyramid. Transform coefficients over each tree correspond to a unique local spatial region of the original image, and they can be coded bit-plane by bit-plane through successive-approximation quantization. After receiving the approximate value of some coefficients, the decoder can obtain a reconstructed image. We show a rational system for progressive transmission that, in absence of a priori knowledge about regions of interest, chooses at any truncation time among alternative trees for further transmission in such a way as to avoid certain forms of behavioral inconsistency. We prove that some rational transmission systems might exhibit aversion to risk involving \"gambles\" on tree-dependent quality of encoding while others favor taking such risks. Based on an acceptable predictor for visual distinctness from digital imagery, we demonstrate that, without any outside knowledge, risk-prone systems as well as those with strong risk aversion appear in capable of attaining the quality of reconstructions that can be achieved with moderate risk-averse behavior", "873": "Programmatic efforts encouraging women to enter the information technology workforce. For over a decade the National Science Foundation (NSF) has been supporting projects designed to improve opportunities for women in computing. From an initial emphasis on increasing the number of women in graduate school studying computer science and engineering, NSF's current emphasis has broadened to include research studies examining the underlying reasons why women are underrepresented in the information technology (IT) workforce. This paper describes the recent history of NSF's activities in this area and the subsequent emergence of a research portfolio addressing the underrepresentation issue", "1380": "A feature-preserving volumetric technique to merge surface triangulations. Several extensions and improvements to surface merging procedures based on the extraction of isosurfaces from a distance map defined on an adaptive background grid are presented. The main objective is to extend the application of these algorithms to surfaces with sharp edges and comers. In order to deal with objects of different length scales, the initial background grids are created using a Delaunay triangulation method and local voxelizations. A point enrichment technique that introduces points into the background grid along detected surface features such as ridges is used to ensure that these features are preserved in the final merged surface. The surface merging methodology is extended to include other Boolean operations between surface triangulations. The iso-surface extraction algorithms are modified to obtain the correct iso-surface for multi-component objects. The procedures are demonstrated with various examples, ranging from simple geometrical entities to complex engineering applications. The present algorithms allow realistic modelling of a large number of complex engineering geometries using overlapping components defined discretely, i.e. via surface triangulations. This capability is very useful for grid generation starting from data originated in measurements or images", "797": "Adaptive wavelet methods. II. Beyond the elliptic case. This paper is concerned with the design and analysis of adaptive wavelet methods for systems of operator equations. Its main accomplishment is to extend the range of applicability of the adaptive wavelet-based method developed previously for symmetric positive definite problems to indefinite or unsymmetric systems of operator equations. This is accomplished by first introducing techniques (such as the least squares formulation developed previously) that transform the original (continuous) problem into an equivalent infinite system of equations which is now well-posed in the Euclidean metric. It is then shown how to utilize adaptive techniques to solve the resulting infinite system of equations. It is shown that for a wide range of problems, this new adaptive method performs with asymptotically optimal complexity, i.e., it recovers an approximate solution with desired accuracy at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of terms in a corresponding wavelet-best N-term approximation. An important advantage of this adaptive approach is that it automatically stabilizes the numerical procedure so that, for instance, compatibility constraints on the choice of trial spaces, like the LBB condition, no longer arise", "1174": "Optimization of cutting conditions for single pass turning operations using a deterministic approach. An optimization analysis, strategy and CAM software for the selection of economic cutting conditions in single pass turning operations are presented using a deterministic approach. The optimization is based on criteria typified by the maximum production rate and includes a host of practical constraints. It is shown that the deterministic optimization approach involving mathematical analyses of constrained economic trends and graphical representation on the feed-speed domain provides a clearly defined strategy that not only provides a unique global optimum solution, but also the software that is suitable for on-line CAM applications. A numerical study has verified the developed optimization strategies and software and has shown the economic benefits of using optimization", "1194": "New methods for oscillatory problems based on classical codes. The numerical integration of differential equations with oscillatory solutions is a very common problem in many fields of the applied sciences. Some methods have been specially devised for this kind of problem. In most of them, the calculation of the coefficients needs more computational effort than the classical codes because such coefficients depend on the step-size in a not simple manner. On the contrary, in this work we present new algorithms specially designed for perturbed oscillators whose coefficients have a simple dependence on the step-size. The methods obtained are competitive when comparing with classical and special codes", "944": "Conditions for the local manipulation of Gaussian states.

This study considers the subjective evaluation of ride quality during ambulance transportation using an actively-controlled stretcher (ACS). The ride quality of a conventional stretcher and an assistant driver's seat is also compared. Braking during ambulance transportation generates negative foot-to-head acceleration in patients and causes blood pressure to rise in the patient's head. The ACS absorbs the foot-to-head acceleration by changing the angle of the stretcher, thus reducing the blood pressure variation. However, the ride quality of the ACS should be investigated further because the movement of the ACS may cause motion sickness and nausea. Experiments of ambulance transportation, including rapid acceleration and deceleration, are performed to evaluate the effect of differences in posture of the transported subject on the ride quality; the semantic differential method and factor analysis are used in the investigations. Subjects are transported using a conventional stretcher with head forward, a conventional stretcher with head backward, the ACS, and an assistant driver's seat for comparison with transportation using a stretcher. Experimental results show that the ACS gives the most comfortable transportation when using a stretcher. Moreover, the reduction of the negative foot-to-head acceleration at frequencies below 0.2 Hz and the small variation of the foot-to-head acceleration result in more comfortable transportation. Conventional transportation with the head forward causes the worst transportation, although the characteristics of the vibration of the conventional stretcher seem to be superior to that of the ACS", "1413": "Web content extraction.

The quantification of perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI (DSC-MRI) requires deconvolution to obtain the residual impulse response function (IRF). In this work, a method using the Gaussian process for deconvolution (GPD) is proposed. The fact that the IRF is smooth is incorporated as a constraint in the method. The GPD method, which automatically estimates the noise level in each voxel, has the advantage that model parameters are optimized automatically. The GPD is compared to singular value decomposition (SVD) using a common threshold for the singular values, and to SVD using a threshold optimized according to the noise level in each voxel. The comparison is carried out using artificial data as well as data from healthy volunteers. It is shown that GPD is comparable to SVD with a variable optimized threshold when determining the maximum of the IRF, which is directly related to the perfusion. GPD provides a better estimate of the entire IRF. As the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases or the time resolution of the measurements increases, GPD is shown to be superior to SVD. This is also found for large distribution volumes", "918": "Schema evolution in data warehouses. We address the issues related to the evolution and maintenance of data warehousing systems, when underlying data sources change their schema capabilities. These changes can invalidate views at the data warehousing system. We present an approach for dynamically adapting views according to schema changes arising on source relations. This type of maintenance concerns both the schema and the data of the data warehouse. The main issue is to avoid the view recomputation from scratch especially when views are defined from multiple sources. The data of the data warehouse is used primarily in organizational decision-making and may be strategic. Therefore, the schema of the data warehouse can evolve for modeling new requirements resulting from analysis or data-mining processing. Our approach provides means to support schema evolution of the data warehouse independently of the data sources", "641": "Multiecho segmented EPI with z-shimmed background gradient compensation (MESBAC) pulse sequence for fMRI. A MultiEcho Segmented EPI with z-shimmed BAckground gradient Compensation (MESBAC) pulse sequence is proposed and validated for functional MRI (fMRI) study in regions suffering from severe susceptibility artifacts. This sequence provides an effective tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution and reduces image distortion and signal dropout. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)-weighted fMRI signal can be reliably obtained in the region of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). To overcome physiological motion artifacts during prolonged multisegment EPI acquisition, two sets of navigator echoes were acquired in both the readout and phase-encoding directions. Ghost artifacts generally produced by single-shot EPI acquisition were eliminated by separately placing the even and odd echoes in different k-space trajectories. Unlike most z-shim methods that focus on increasing temporal resolution for event-related functional brain mapping, the MESBAC sequence simultaneously addresses problems of image distortion and signal dropout while maintaining sufficient temporal resolution. The MESBAC sequence will be particularly useful for pharmacological and affective fMRI studies in brain regions such as the OFC, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, para-hippocampus, etc", "1048": "Parallel and distributed Haskells. Parallel and distributed languages specify computations on multiple processors and have a computation language to describe the algorithm, i.e. what to compute, and a coordination language to describe how to organise the computations across the processors. Haskell has been used as the computation language for a wide variety of parallel and distributed languages, and this paper is a comprehensive survey of implemented languages. It outlines parallel and distributed language concepts and classifies Haskell extensions using them. Similar example programs are used to illustrate and contrast the coordination languages, and the comparison is facilitated by the common computation language. A lazy language is not an obvious choice for parallel or distributed computation, and we address the question of why Haskell is a common functional computation language", "1397": "Computer program for calculating the p-value in testing process capability index C/sub pmk/. Many process capability indices, including C/sub p/, C/sub pk/, and C/sub pm/, have been proposed to provide numerical measures on the process potential and performance. Combining the advantages of these indices, Pearn et al. (1992) introduced a new capability index called C/sub pmk/, which has been shown to be a useful capability index for processes with two-sided specification limits. In this paper, the authors implement the theory of a testing hypothesis using the natural estimator of C/sub pmk/, and provide an efficient Maple computer program to calculate the p-values. They also provide tables of the critical values for some commonly used capability requirements. Based on the test, they develop a simple step-by-step procedure for in-plant applications. The practitioners can use the proposed procedure to determine whether their process meets the preset capability requirement, and make reliable decisions", "1059": "Mustering motivation to enact decisions: how decision process characteristics influence goal realization. Decision scientists tend to focus mainly on decision antecedents, studying how people make decisions. Action psychologists, in contrast, study post-decision issues, investigating how decisions, once formed, are maintained, protected, and enacted. Through the research presented here, we seek to bridge these two disciplines, proposing that the process by which decisions are reached motivates subsequent pursuit and benefits eventual realization. We identify three characteristics of the decision process (DP) as having motivation-mustering potential: DP effort investment, DP importance, and DP confidence. Through two field studies tracking participants' decision processes, pursuit and realization, we find that after controlling for the influence of the motivational mechanisms of goal intention and implementation intention, the three decision process characteristics significantly influence the successful enactment of the chosen decision directly. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are considered and future research opportunities are identified", "1187": "Ethernet networks: getting down to business.

Given the ever-increasing scale and diversity of information and applications on the Internet, improving the technology of information retrieval is an urgent research objective. Retrieved information is either semi-structured or unstructured in format and its sources are extremely heterogeneous. In consequence, the task of efficiently gathering and extracting information from documents can be both difficult and tedious. Given this variety of sources and formats, many choose to use mediator/wrapper architecture, but its use demands a fast means of generating efficient wrappers. In this paper, we present a design for an automatic eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-based framework with which to generate wrappers rapidly. Wrappers created with this framework support a unified interface for a meta-search information retrieval system based on the Internet Search Service using the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) standard. Greatly advantaged by the compatibility of CORBA and XML, a user can quickly and easily develop information-gathering applications, such as a meta-search engine or any other information source retrieval method.

This paper presents a supervised competitive learning network approach, called a fuzzy-soft learning vector quantization, for control chart pattern recognition. Unnatural patterns in control charts mean that there are some unnatural causes for variations in statistical process control (SPC). Hence, control chart pattern recognition becomes more important in SPC. In order to detect effectively the patterns for the six main types of control charts, Pham and Oztemel (1994) described a class of pattern recognizers for control charts based on the learning vector quantization (LVQ) such as LVQ, LVQ2 and LVQ-X etc. In this paper, we propose a new supervised LVQ for control charts based on a fuzzy-soft competitive learning network. The proposed fuzzy-soft LVQ (FS-LVQ) uses a fuzzy relaxation technique and simultaneously updates all neurons. It can increase correct recognition accuracy and also decrease the learning time.

Uncertainties are assumed for the load resistance R=R/sub O/(1+ delta /sub R/), inductance L=L/sub O/(1+ delta /sub L/), and capacitance C=C/sub O/(1+ delta /sub C/). The interest in these models is clearly motivated by the need to have models for switch-mode DC-DC converters that are compatible with robust control analysis, which require a model structure consisting of a nominal model and a norm-bounded modeling uncertainty. Therefore, robust stability analysis can be realized using standard mu -tools.

The main outputs of the developed model include explored inconsistent tuples and consumed processing time. We further conducted an empirical test where eighteen continuous real-life datasets granulized by the equal width interval technique that embedded S-plus histogram binning algorithm (SHBA) and largest binning size algorithm (LBSA) binning algorithms were diagnosed.

Then, the nonlinear phase error is approximated by a weighted equation error such that the cost function can be converted into a quadratic form. Next, by minimizing the weighted equation error, the optimal polynomial coefficients can be obtained iteratively by solving a set of linear simultaneous equations at each iteration.

A digital elevation model (DEM) can be extracted automatically from stereo satellite images. During the past decade, the most common satellite data used to extract DEM was the across-track SPOT. Recently, the addition of along-track ASTER data, which can be downloaded freely, provides another attractive alternative to extract DEM data. This work compares the automated DEM extraction results using an ASTER stereo pair and a SPOT stereo pair over an area of hilly mountains in Drum Mountain, Utah, when compared to a USGS 7.5-min DEM standard product. The result shows that SPOT produces better DEM results in terms of accuracy and details, if the radiometric variations between the images, taken on subsequent satellite revolutions, are small. Otherwise, the ASTER stereo pair is a better choice because of simultaneous along-track acquisition during a single pass.

The relationship between main hemodynamic parameters. The severity of coronary arterial stenosis is usually measured by either simple geometrical parameters, such as percent diameter stenosis, or hemodynamically based parameters, such as the fractional flow reserve (FFR) or coronary flow reserve (CFR). The present study aimed to establish a relationship between actual hemodynamic conditions and the parameters that define stenosis severity in the clinical setting. We used a computational model of the blood flow in a vessel with a blunt stenosis and an autoregulated vascular bed to simulate a stenosed blood vessel. A key point in creating realistic simulations is to properly model arterial autoregulation. A constant flow regulation mechanism resulted in CFR and FFR values that were within the physiological range, while a constant wall-shear stress model yielded unrealistic values.

Modern techniques such as remote sensing have been one of the main factors leading toward the achievement of serious plans regarding coastal management.

A generalized upper bound model for calculating the chip flow angle in oblique cutting using flat-faced nose radius tools is described.

The length of each of these elements is used to find the length of the corresponding element on the shear surface using the ratio of the shear velocity to the chip velocity. The area of each element is found as the cross product of the length and its width along the cutting edge. Summing up the area of the elements along the shear surface, the total shear surface area is obtained. The friction area is calculated using the similarity between orthogonal and oblique cutting in the 'equivalent' plane that includes both the cutting velocity and chip velocity. The cutting power is obtained by summing the shear power and the friction power. The actual chip flow angle and chip velocity are obtained by minimizing the cutting power with respect to both these variables.

The active finger consists of two bending parts, the SMA actuators and a connecting part. The mechanical properties of the bending part are investigated. The control system on the basis of resistance feedback is also presented. Finally, a robot hand with three fingers was designed and the grasping experiment was carried out to demonstrate its performance", "1239": "Three-dimensional global MHD simulation code for the Earth's magnetosphere using HPF/JA. We have translated a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation code of the Earth's magnetosphere from VPP Fortran to HPF/JA on the Fujitsu VPP5000/56 vector-parallel supercomputer and the MHD code was fully vectorized and fully parallelized in VPP Fortran. The entire performance and capability of the HPF MHD code could be shown to be almost comparable to that of VPP Fortran. A three-dimensional global MHD simulation of the Earth's magnetosphere was performed at a speed of over 400 Gflops with an efficiency of 76.5% using 56 processing elements of the Fujitsu VPP5000/56 in vector and parallel computation that permitted comparison with catalog values. We have concluded that fluid and MHD codes that are fully vectorized and fully parallelized in VPP Fortran can be translated with relative ease to HPF/JA, and a code in HPF/JA may be expected to perform comparably to the same code written in VPP Fortran", "1274": "Bounded model checking for the universal fragment of CTL. Bounded Model Checking (BMC) has been recently introduced as an efficient verification method for reactive systems. BMC based on SAT methods consists in searching for a counterexample of a particular length and generating a propositional formula that is satisfiable iff such a counterexample-exists. This new technique has been introduced by E. Clarke et al. for model checking of linear time temporal logic (LTL). Our paper shows how the concept of bounded model checking can be extended to ACTL (the universal fragment of CTL).

Sometimes it's not what you do, but how you do it. After hackers broke the blocking code on the home version of its popular Cyber Patrol Internet filtering software and posted it on the Internet, marketers at Microsystems Software pulled out a playbook of standard crisis management and PR techniques. But the Cyber Patrol PR team including outside PR counsel and the company's outside law firm, used those tools aggressively in order to turn the tide of public and media opinion away from the hackers, who initially were hailed as folk heroes, and in favor of the company's interests, to save the product's and the company's reputations and inherent value.

Fred Dretske and Jerry Fodor are responsible for popularizing three well-known theses in contemporary philosophy of mind: the thesis of Information-Based Semantics (IBS), the thesis of Content Atomism (Atomism) and the thesis of the Language of Thought (LOT). LOT concerns the semantically relevant structure of representations involved in cognitive states such as beliefs and desires. It maintains that all such representations must have syntactic structures mirroring the structure of their contents. IBS is a thesis about the nature of the relations that connect cognitive representations and their parts to their contents (semantic relations). It holds that these relations supervene solely on relations of the kind that support information content, perhaps with some help from logical principles of combination. Atomism is a thesis about the nature of the content of simple symbols. It holds that each substantive simple symbol possesses its content independently of all other symbols in the representational system. I argue that Dretske's and Fodor's theories are false and that their falsehood results from a conflict IBS and Atomism, on the one hand, and LOT, on the other", "566": "Sensing and control of double-sided arc welding process. The welding industry is driven to improve productivity without sacrificing quality. For thick material welding, the current practice is to use backing or multiple passes. The laser welding process, capable of achieving deep narrow penetration, can significantly improve welding productivity for such applications by reducing the number of passes. However, its competitiveness in comparison with traditional arc welding is weakened by its high cost, strict fit-up requirement, and difficulty in welding large structures. In this work, a different method, referred to as double-sided arc welding (DSAW) is developed to improve the arc concentration for arc welding. A sensing and control system is developed to achieve deep narrow penetration under variations in welding conditions. Experiments verified that the pulsed keyhole DSAW system developed is capable of achieving deep narrow penetration on a 1/2 inch thick square butt joint in a single pass", "1190": "Buying into the relationship [business software].

This paper presents a model of discourse acts that participants use to communicate their attitudes to each other, or affect the attitudes of others, in such environments. The first part deals with the knowledge representation and communication aspects of the problem, while the second one, in the context of an already implemented system, namely HERMES, with issues related to the configuration of the contributions asserted at each discourse instance.

This paper reports on how the conference experience immediately affected these students - what impressed them, what scared them, what it clarified for them. It also reports on how the context in which these students currently evaluate their ability, potential and opportunity in computer science is different now from what it was before the conference.

The main focus of the paper is directed at the determination of manufacturing errors within the contemporary smaller manufacturing enterprise sector. The manufacturing error diagnosis is achieved through the manufacturing data analysis of the results obtained from the inspection of the component on a co-ordinate measuring machine. This manufacturing data analysis activity adopts a feature-based approach and is conducted through the application of a forward chaining expert system, called the product data analysis distributed diagnostic expert system, which forms part of a larger prototype feedback system entitled the production data analysis framework. The paper introduces the manufacturing error categorisations that are associated with milling type operations, knowledge acquisition and representation, conceptual structure and operating procedure of the prototype manufacturing data analysis facility. The paper concludes with a brief evaluation of the logic employed through the simulation of manufacturing error scenarios. This prototype manufacturing data analysis expert system provides a valuable aid for the rapid diagnosis and elimination of manufacturing errors on a 3-axis vertical machining centre in an environment where operator expertise is limited", "728": "Questioning the RFP process [telecom].

This paper reviews and addresses the principles of linear controller design of the fixed speed wind turbine system in above rated wind speed, using pitch angle control of the blades and applying modern control theory. First, the nonlinear equations of the system are built in under some reasonable suppositions. Then, the nonlinear equations are linearised at set operating point and digital simulation results are shown in this paper. Finally, a linear quadratic optimal feedback controller is designed and the dynamics of the closed circle system are simulated with digital calculation. The advantages and disadvantages of the assumptions and design method are also discussed. Because of the inherent characteristics of the linear system control theory, the performance of the linear controller is not sufficient for operating wind turbines, as is discussed", "960": "Bisimulation minimization and symbolic model checking. State space minimization techniques are crucial for combating state explosion. A variety of explicit-state verification tools use bisimulation minimization to check equivalence between systems, to minimize components before composition, or to reduce a state space prior to model checking. Experimental results on bisimulation minimization in symbolic model checking contexts, however, are mixed. We explore bisimulation minimization as an optimization in symbolic model checking of invariance properties. We consider three bisimulation minimization algorithms. From each, we produce a BDD-based model checker for invariant properties and compare this model checker to a conventional one based on backwards reachability. Our comparisons, both theoretical and experimental, suggest that bisimulation minimization is not viable in the context of invariance verification, because performing the minimization requires as many, if not more, computational resources as model checking the unminimized system through backwards reachability", "829": "Santera targets independents in major strategy overhaul [telecom].

When processing measurement data, it is usually assumed that some amount of normally distributed measurement noise is present. In some situations, outliers are present in the measurements and consequently the noise is far from normally distributed. In this case classical least-squares procedures for estimating Fourier spectra (or derived quantities like the frequency response function) can give results which are inaccurate or even useless. In this paper, a novel technique for the on-line processing of measurement outliers will be proposed. Both the computation speed and the accuracy of the technique presented will be compared with different classical approaches for handling outliers in measurement data (i.e. filtering techniques, outlier rejection techniques and robust regression techniques). In particular, all processing techniques will be validated by applying them to the problem of speckle drop-out in optical vibration measurements (performed with a laser Doppler vibrometer), which typically causes outliers in the measurements", "947": "The fully entangled fraction as an inclusive measure of entanglement applications. Characterizing entanglement in all but the simplest case of a two qubit pure state is a hard problem, even understanding the relevant experimental quantities that are related to entanglement is difficult. It may not be necessary, however, to quantify the entanglement of a state in order to quantify the quantum information processing significance of a state. It is known that the fully entangled fraction has a direct relationship to the fidelity of teleportation maximized under the actions of local unitary operations. In the case of two qubits we point out that the fully entangled fraction can also be related to the fidelities, maximized under the actions of local unitary operations, of other important quantum information tasks such as dense coding, entanglement swapping and quantum cryptography in such a way as to provide an inclusive measure of these entanglement applications. For two qubit systems the fully entangled fraction has a simple known closed-form expression and we establish lower and upper bounds of this quantity with the concurrence. This approach is readily extendable to more complicated systems", "1058": "Bigger is better: the influence of physical size on aesthetic preference judgments. The hypothesis that the physical size of an object can influence aesthetic preferences was investigated. In a series of four experiments, participants were presented with pairs of abstract stimuli and asked to indicate which member of each pair they preferred. A preference for larger stimuli was found on the majority of trials using various types of stimuli, stimuli of various sizes, and with both adult and 3-year-old participants. This preference pattern was disrupted only when participants had both stimuli that provided a readily accessible alternative source of preference-evoking information and sufficient attentional resources to make their preference judgments", "77": "Modeling frequently accessed wireless data with weak consistency. To reduce the response times of wireless data access in a mobile network, caches are utilized in wireless handheld devices. If the original data entry has been updated, the cached data in the handheld device becomes stale. Thus, a mechanism is required to predict when the cached copy will expire. This paper studies a weakly consistent data access mechanism that computes the time-to-live (TTL) interval to predict the expiration time. We propose an analytic model to investigate this TTL-based algorithm for frequently accessed data. The analytic model is validated against simulation experiments. Our study quantitatively indicates how the TTL-based algorithm reduces the wireless communication cost by increasing the probability of stale accesses.

This paper presents a new biorthogonal linear-phase wavelet design for image compression. Instead of calculating the prototype filters as spectral factors of a half-band filter, the design is based on the direct optimization of the low pass analysis filter using an objective function directly related to a perceptual criterion for image compression. This function is defined as the product of the theoretical coding gain and an index called the peak-to-peak ratio, which was shown to have high correlation with perceptual quality. A distinctive feature of the proposed technique is a procedure by which, given a \"good\" starting filter, \"good\" filters of longer lengths are generated. The results are excellent, showing a clear improvement in perceptual image quality. Also, we devised a criterion for constraining the coefficients of the filters in order to design wavelets with minimum ringing", "1138": "Approximating martingales for variance reduction in Markov process simulation. \"Knowledge of either analytical or numerical approximations should enable more efficient simulation estimators to be constructed.\" This principle seems intuitively plausible and certainly attractive, yet no completely satisfactory general methodology has been developed to exploit it.

The network parameters and variables are defined as symbols. The symbolic analyzer, which models analytically the power system DC load flows, enables the sensitivity analysis of the power system to parameter and variable variations (costs, transfers, injections), a valuable tool for the expansion planning analysis. That virtue could not be found within the conventional approach, relying on compensation methods, precalculated distribution factors, and so on.

An investigation has been undertaken into the frame sawing with diamond blades. The kinematic behaviour of the frame sawing process is discussed. Under different cutting conditions, cutting and indenting-cutting tests are carried out by single point cutting tools and single diamond segments. The results indicate that the depth of cut per diamond grit increases as the blades move forward. Only a few grits per segment can remove the material in the cutting process. When the direction of the stroke changes, the cutting forces do not decrease to zero because of the residual plastic deformation beneath the diamond grits. The plastic deformation and fracture chipping of material are the dominant removal processes, which can be explained by the fracture theory of brittle material indentation", "971": "Homogenization in L/sup infinity /.

This paper presents a special hierarchical fuzzy system where the outputs of the previous layer are not used in the IF-parts, but used only in the THEN-parts of the fuzzy rules of the current layer. The proposed scheme can be shown to be a universal approximator to any continuous function on a compact set if complete fuzzy sets are used in the IF-parts of the fuzzy rules with singleton fuzzifier and center average defuzzifier.

Many real-world systems are multi-state systems composed of multi-state components in which the reliability can be computed in terms of the lower bound points of level d, called d-Mincuts (d-MCs). Such systems (electric power, transportation, etc.) may be regarded as flow networks whose arcs have independent, discrete, limited and multi-valued random capacities. In this paper, all MCs are assumed to be known in advance, and the authors focused on how to verify each d-MC candidate before using d-MCs to calculate the network reliability. The proposed algorithm is more efficient than existing algorithms. The algorithm runs in O(p sigma mn) time, a significant improvement over the previous O(p sigma m/sup 2/) time bounds based on max-flow/min-cut, where p and or are the number of MCs and d-MC candidates, respectively. It is simple, intuitive and uses no complex data structures. An example is given to show how all d-MC candidates are found and verified by the proposed algorithm.

In a recent survey, AMR Research found that companies that use reverse auctions to negotiate prices with suppliers typically achieve savings of between 10% and 15% on direct goods and between 20% and 25% on indirect goods, and can slash sourcing cycle times from months to weeks. Suppliers, however, are less enthusiastic. They believe that these savings are achieved only by stripping the human element out of negotiations and evaluating bids on price alone, which drives down their profit margins. As a result, reverse auctions carry the risk of jeopardising long-term and trusted relationships. Suppliers that have not been involved in a reverse auction before typically fear the bidding event itself - arguably the most theatrical and, therefore, most hyped-up part of the process.

We describe a postprocessing methodology for reconstructing undersampled image sequences with randomly varying blur that can provide image enhancement beyond the sampling resolution of the sensor. This method is demonstrated on simulated imagery and on adaptive-optics-(AO)-compensated imagery taken by the Starfire Optical Range 3.5-m telescope that has been artificially undersampled. Also shown are the results of multiframe blind deconvolution of some of the highest quality optical imagery of low earth orbit satellites collected with a ground-based telescope to date. The algorithm used is a generalization of multiframe blind deconvolution techniques that include a representation of spatial sampling by the focal plane array elements based on a forward stochastic model. This generalization enables the random shifts and shape of the AO-compensated point spread function (PSF) to be used to partially eliminate the aliasing effects associated with sub-Nyquist sampling of the image by the focal plane array. The method could be used to reduce resolution loss that occurs when imaging in wide-field-of-view (FOV) modes", "722": "Updating systems for monitoring and controlling power equipment on the basis of the firmware system SARGON.

The estimates from an EM, when it is applied to a large causal model of 10 or more categorical variables, are often subject to the initial values for the estimates. This phenomenon becomes more serious as the model structure becomes more complicated involving more variables. As a measure of compensation for this, it has been recommended in literature that EMs are implemented several times with different sets of initial values to obtain more appropriate estimates. We propose an improved approach for initial values. The main idea is that we use initials that are calibrated to data. A simulation result strongly indicates that the calibrated initials give rise to the estimates that are far closer to the true values than the initials that are not calibrated", "991": "Estimation of blocking probabilities in cellular networks with dynamic channel assignment. Blocking probabilities in cellular mobile communication networks using dynamic channel assignment are hard to compute for realistic sized systems. This computational difficulty is due to the structure of the state space, which imposes strong coupling constraints amongst components of the occupancy vector. Approximate tractable models have been proposed, which have product form stationary state distributions. However, for real channel assignment schemes, the product form is a poor approximation and it is necessary to simulate the actual occupancy process in order to estimate the blocking probabilities. Meaningful estimates of the blocking probability typically require an enormous amount of CPU time for simulation, since blocking events are usually rare. Advanced simulation approaches use importance sampling (IS) to overcome this problem. We study two regimes under which blocking is a rare event: low-load and high cell capacity. Our simulations use the standard clock (SC) method. For low load, we propose a change of measure that we call static ISSC, which has bounded relative error. For high capacity, we use a change of measure that depends on the current state of the network occupancy. This is the dynamic ISSC method. We prove that this method yields zero variance estimators for single clique models, and we empirically show the advantages of this method over naive simulation for networks of moderate size and traffic loads", "808": "A novel control logic for fast valving operations.

The authors describe the implementation, use, and performance evaluation of a FIFO queue class library by means of a high-performance, easy-to-use interface employed for queuing simulations in parallel discrete simulations based on the time warp method. Various general-purpose simulation libraries and languages have been proposed, and among these some have the advantage of not requiring users to define anything other than the state vector, and not needing awareness of rollback under a platform which performs state control based on copies. However, because the state vectors must be defined as simple data structures without pointers, dynamic data structures such as a FIFO queue cannot be handled directly. Under the proposed class library, both the platform and the user can handle such structures in the same fashion that embedded data structures are handled. In addition, instead of all stored data, just the operational history can be stored and recovered efficiently at an effectively minimal cost by taking advantage of the first-in-first-out characteristics of the above data structures.

This paper compares four power converter topologies for the implementation of flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) controllers: three multilevel topologies (multipoint clamped (MPC), chain, and nested cell) and the well-established multipulse topology. In keeping with the need to implement very-high-power inverters, switching frequency is restricted to line frequency. The study addresses device count, DC filter ratings, restrictions on voltage control, active power transfer through the DC link, and balancing of DC-link voltages. Emphasis is placed on capacitor sizing because of its impact on the cost and size of the FACTS controller. A method for the dimensioning the DC capacitor filter is presented.

A sequence of single photons is emitted on demand from a single three-level atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse optical cavity. The photons are generated by an adiabatically driven stimulated Raman transition between two atomic ground states, with the vacuum field of the cavity stimulating one branch of the transition, and laser pulses deterministically driving the other branch. This process is unitary and therefore intrinsically reversible, which is essential for quantum communication and networking, and the photons should be appropriate for all-optical quantum information processing", "1353": "Generalized spatio-chromatic diffusion. A framework for diffusion of color images is presented. The method is based on the theory of thermodynamics of irreversible transformations which provides a suitable basis for designing correlations between the different color channels. More precisely, we derive an equation for color evolution which comprises a purely spatial diffusive term and a nonlinear term that depends on the interactions among color channels over space. We apply the proposed equation to images represented in several color spaces, such as RGB, CIELAB, Opponent colors, and IHS", "637": "A digital fountain approach to asynchronous reliable multicast. The proliferation of applications that must reliably distribute large, rich content to a vast number of autonomous receivers motivates the design of new multicast and broadcast protocols. We describe an ideal, fully scalable protocol for these applications that we call a digital fountain. A digital fountain allows any number of heterogeneous receivers to acquire content with optimal efficiency at times of their choosing. Moreover, no feedback channels are needed to ensure reliable delivery, even in the face of high loss rates. We develop a protocol that closely approximates a digital fountain using two new classes of erasure codes that for large block sizes are orders of magnitude faster than standard erasure codes. We provide performance measurements that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and discuss the design, implementation, and performance of an experimental system", "978": "On Implicit Euler for high-order high-index DAEs. The Implicit Euler method is seldom used to solve differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of differential index r >or= 3, since the method in general fails to converge in the first r - 2 steps after a change of stepsize. However, if the differential equation is of order d = r - 1 >or= 1, an alternative variable-step version of the Euler method can be shown uniformly convergent. For d = r - 1, this variable-step method is equivalent to the Implicit Euler except for the first r - 2 steps after a change of stepsize. Generalization to DAEs with differential equations of order d > r - 1 >or= 1, and to variable-order formulas is discussed", "1428": "Syndicators turn to the enterprise.

The conventional wisdom has been that Internet protocol (IP) is the natural protocol layer for implementing multicast related functionality. However, more than a decade after its initial proposal, IP multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability, network management, deployment, and support for higher layer functionality such as error, flow, and congestion control. We explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast, where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP multicast. However, the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model. In particular, end system multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end-to-end delays than IP multicast. We study these performance concerns in the context of the Narada protocol. In Narada, end systems self-organize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol. Further, end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance. We present details of Narada and evaluate it using both simulation and Internet experiments. Our results indicate that the performance penalties are low both from the application and the network perspectives. We believe the potential benefits of transferring multicast functionality from end systems to routers significantly outweigh the performance penalty incurred", "1227": "Will new Palms win laurels.?.

This paper proposes an automatic attack construction algorithm in order to find potential attacks on security protocols. It is based on a dynamic strand space model, which enhances the original strand space model by introducing active nodes on strands so as to characterize the dynamic procedure of protocol execution. With exact causal dependency relations between messages considered in the model, this algorithm can avoid state space explosion caused by asynchronous composition. In order to get a finite state space, a new method called strand-added on demand is exploited, which extends a bundle in an incremental manner without requiring explicit configuration of protocol execution parameters. A finer granularity model of term structure is also introduced, in which subterms are divided into check subterms and data subterms. Moreover, data subterms can be further classified based on the compatible data subterm relation to obtain automatically the finite set of valid acceptable terms for an honest principal. In this algorithm, terms core is designed to represent the intruder's knowledge compactly, and forward search technology is used to simulate attack patterns easily. Using this algorithm, a new attack on the Dolve-Yao protocol can be found, which is even more harmful because the secret is revealed before the session terminates", "142": "Surface micromachined paraffin-actuated microvalve.

Practical experience has taught many Java developers one thing: critical resources (mutexes, database connections, transactions, file handles, etc.) require timely and systematic release. Unfortunately, Java's garbage collector is not up to that job. According to the Java Language Specification, there are no guarantees when a garbage collector will run, when it will collect an object, or when it will finalize an object - if ever. Even more unfortunately, Java's counterpart to the C++ destructor (the finally block) is both tedious and error-prone, requiring developers to constantly remember and duplicate resource-releasing code. Consequently, even good Java developers can forget to release critical resources. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Java may make it easier to leak critical resources, but it also provides the necessary mechanisms to easily track them down. The Tattletale technique is a simple method for designing new classes and retrofitting existing classes to quickly and easily detect the offending code responsible for leaking resources", "1345": "Infrared-image classification using hidden Markov trees. An image of a three-dimensional target is generally characterized by the visible target subcomponents, with these dictated by the target-sensor orientation (target pose). An image often changes quickly with variable pose. We define a class as a set of contiguous target-sensor orientations over which the associated target image is relatively stationary with aspect. Each target is in general characterized by multiple classes. A distinct set of Wiener filters are employed for each class of images, to identify the presence of target subcomponents. A Karhunen-Loeve representation is used to minimize the number of filters (templates) associated with a given subcomponent.

We present a quasi-2-D real-time inversion algorithm for a modern galvanic array tool via dimensional reduction and neural network simulation. Using reciprocity and superposition, we apply a numerical focusing technique to the unfocused data. The numerically focused data are much less subject to 2-D and layering effects and can be approximated as from a cylindrical 1-D Earth. We then perform 1-D inversion on the focused data to provide approximate information about the 2-D resistivity structure. A neural network is used to perform forward modeling in the 1-D inversion, which is several hundred times faster than conventional numerical forward solutions. Testing our inversion algorithm on both synthetic and field data shows that this fast inversion algorithm is useful for providing formation resistivity information at a well site", "987": "Proof that the election problem belongs to NF-completeness problems in asynchronous distributed systems.

It is shown that problems encountered in the system are classified as three classes of problems: F (fault-tolerant), NF (Not fault-tolerant) and NFC (NF-completeness).

This paper presents an optical actuation scheme for MEMS devices based on the well-established fact that light possesses momentum, and hence, imparts a force equal to 2 W/c when reflected by a surface. Here, W is the total power of the reflected light, and c is the speed of light. Radiation pressure, as it is known, is nearly insignificant for most macroscale applications, but it can be quite significant for MEMS devices. In addition, light actuation offers a new paradigm. First, intersecting light beams do not interfere, in contrast to electrical conductors, which short when they come into contact. Second, light can operate in high temperature and high radiation environments far outside the capability of solid state electronic components. This actuation method is demonstrated, both in air and in vacuum, by switching the state of a bistable MEMS device.

Several applications are based on the assessment of a linear model linking a set of variables Y to a set of predictors X. In the presence of strong colinearity among predictors, as in the case with spectral data, several alternative procedures to ordinary least squares (OLS) are proposed, We discuss a new alternative approach which we refer to as regression models through constrained principal components analysis (RM-CPCA). This method basically shares certain common characteristics with PLS regression as the dependent variables play a central role in determining the latent variables to be used as predictors. Unlike PLS, however, the approach discussed leads to straightforward models. This method also bears some similarity to latent root regression analysis (LRR) that was discussed by several authors. Moreover, a tuning parameter that ranges between 0 and 1 is introduced and the family of models thus formed includes several other methods as particular cases", "1155": "A leaf sequencing algorithm to enlarge treatment field length in IMRT. With MLC-based IMRT, the maximum usable field size is often smaller than the maximum field size for conventional treatments. This is due to the constraints of the overtravel distances of MLC leaves and/or jaws. Using a new leaf sequencing algorithm, the usable IMRT field length (perpendicular to the MLC motion) can be mostly made equal to the full length of the MLC field without violating the upper jaw overtravel limit. For any given intensity pattern, a criterion was proposed to assess whether an intensity pattern can be delivered without violation of the jaw position constraints. If the criterion is met, the new algorithm will consider the jaw position constraints during the segmentation for the step and shoot delivery method. The strategy employed by the algorithm is to connect the intensity elements outside the jaw overtravel limits with those inside the jaw overtravel limits. Several methods were used to establish these connections during segmentation by modifying a previously published algorithm (areal algorithm), including changing the intensity level, alternating the leaf-sequencing direction, or limiting the segment field size. The algorithm was tested with 1000 random intensity patterns with dimensions of 21*27 cm/sup 2/, 800 intensity patterns with higher intensity outside the jaw overtravel limit, and three different types of clinical treatment plans that were undeliverable using a segmentation method from a commercial treatment planning system. The new algorithm achieved a success rate of 100% with these test patterns. For the 1000 random patterns, the new algorithm yields a similar average number of segments of 36.9+or-2.9 in comparison to 36.6+or-1.3 when using the areal algorithm. For the 800 patterns with higher intensities outside the jaw overtravel limits, the new algorithm results in an increase of 25% in the average number of segments compared to the areal algorithm. However, the areal algorithm fails to create deliverable segments for 90% of these patterns. Using a single isocenter, the new algorithm provides a solution to extend the usable IMRT field length from 21 to 27 cm for IMRT on a commercial linear accelerator using the step and shoot delivery method", "1166": "Embedding the outer automorphism group Out(F/sub n/) of a free group of rank n in the group Out(F/sub m/) for m > n.

The platform transforms any echograph into a test-system for evaluating the diagnostic effectiveness of new investigation techniques. A particular user interface was designed in order to allow a real-time and simultaneous visualization of the results produced in the different stages of the chosen processing procedure. This is aimed at obtaining a better optimization of the processing algorithm. The most important platform aspect, which also constitutes the basic differentiation with respect to similar systems, is the direct processing of the radiofrequency echo signal, which is essential for a complete analysis of the particular ultrasound-media interaction phenomenon. The platform completely integrates the architecture of a personal computer (PC) giving rise to several benefits, such as the quick technological evolution in the PC field and an extreme degree of programmability for different applications.

In this new scheme, the canonical property of the SPT values is preserved under genetic operations. Additionally, two new features that drastically improve the performance of our GA are introduced. (1) An additional level of natural selection is introduced to simulate the effect of natural selection when sperm cells compete to fertilize an ovule; this dramatically improves the offspring survival rate. A conventional GA is analogous to intracytoplasmic sperm injection and has an extremely low offspring survival rate, resulting in very slow convergence. (2) The probability of mutation for each codon of a chromosome is weighted by the reciprocal of its effect.

IMRT treatment plans for step-and-shoot delivery have traditionally been produced through the optimization of intensity distributions (or maps) for each beam angle. The optimization step is followed by the application of a leaf-sequencing algorithm that translates each intensity map into a set of deliverable aperture shapes. In this article, we introduce an automated planning system in which we bypass the traditional intensity optimization, and instead directly optimize the shapes and the weights of the apertures. We call this approach \"direct aperture optimization.\" This technique allows the user to specify the maximum number of apertures per beam direction, and hence provides significant control over the complexity of the treatment delivery. This is possible because the machine dependent delivery constraints imposed by the MLC are enforced within the aperture optimization algorithm rather than in a separate leaf-sequencing step. The leaf settings and the aperture intensities are optimized simultaneously using a simulated annealing algorithm. We have tested direct aperture optimization on a variety of patient cases using the EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package for our dose calculation engine. The results demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can produce highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans using only three to five apertures per beam direction. As compared with traditional optimization strategies, our studies demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can result in a significant reduction in both the number of beam segments and the number of monitor units. Direct aperture optimization therefore produces highly efficient treatment deliveries that maintain the full dosimetric benefits of IMRT", "850": "Encouraging women in computer science.

The application of forward light scattering methods for estimating the particle size distribution (PSD) is usually limited by the occurrence of multiple scattering, which affects the angular distribution of light in highly concentrated suspensions, thus resulting in false calculations by the conventionally adopted algorithms. In this paper, a previously proposed neural network-based method is tested with different particle systems, in order to evaluate its applicability. In the first step of the study, experiments were carried out with solid-liquid suspensions having different characteristics of particle shape and size distribution, under varying solid concentrations. The experimental results, consisting of the angular distribution of light intensity, particle shape and suspension concentration, were used as input data in the fitting of neural network models (NN) that replaced the optical model to provide the PSD. The reference values of particle shape and PSD for the NN fitting were based on image analysis.

In this paper, a feedback mechanism for AF aggregated flows is proposed to solve this problem. Simulation results show that this mechanism does improve the performance of DiffServ. First, it can improve the fairness among aggregated flows and make DiffServ more friendly toward TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) flows.

On this basis, a fractional-order controller is proposed, which functions as phase stabilization control for lower frequency and smoothly enters to amplitude stabilization at higher frequency by proper amplitude attenuation. It is shown that the equivalent damping ratio increases in proportion to the square of frequency", "632": "Modelling dependencies in paired comparison data a log-linear approach. In many Bradley-Terry models a more or less explicit assumption is that all decisions of the judges are independent. An assumption which might be questionable at least for the decisions of a given judge. In paired comparison studies, a judge chooses among objects several times, and in such cases, judgements made by the same judge are likely to be dependent. A log-linear representation for the Bradley-Terry model is developed, which takes into account dependencies between judgements. The modelling of the dependencies is embedded in the analysis of multiple binomial responses, which has the advantage of interpretability in terms of conditional odds ratios. Furthermore, the modelling is done in the framework of generalized linear models, thus parameter estimation and the assessment of goodness of fit can be obtained in the standard way by using e.g. GLIM or another standard software", "721": "The results of experimental studies of the reflooding of fuel-rod assemblies from above and problems for future investigations.

The scope of this paper is the provision of intelligent product support within the distributed Intranet/Internet environment. From the point of view of user requirements, the limitations of conventional product manuals and methods of authoring them are first outlined. It is argued that enhanced product support requires new technology solutions both for product manuals and for their authoring and presentation. The concept and the architecture of intelligent product manuals are then discussed. A prototype system called ProARTWeb is presented to demonstrate advanced features of intelligent product manuals. Next, the problem of producing such manuals in a cost-effective way is addressed and a concurrent engineering approach to their authoring is proposed. An integrated environment for collaborative authoring called ProAuthor is described to illustrate the approach suggested and to show how consistent, up-to-date and user-oriented-product manuals can be designed. The solutions presented here enable product knowledge to be captured and delivered to users and developers of product manuals when, where and in the form they need it", "553": "Application of traditional system design techniques to Web site design. After several decades of computer program construction there emerged a set of principles that provided guidance to produce more manageable programs.

This paper reviews the traditional principles of structured programming and the preferred characteristics of Web sites. Finally a mapping of how the traditional guidelines may be applied to Web site construction is presented. The application of the traditional principles of structured programming to the design of a Web site can provide a more usable site for the visitors to the site. The additional benefit of using these time-honored techniques is the creation of a Web site that will be easier to maintain by the development staff", "1358": "Analysis of the surface roughness and dimensional accuracy capability of fused deposition modelling processes. Building up materials in layers poses significant challenges from the viewpoint of material science, heat transfer and applied mechanics. However, numerous aspects of the use of these technologies have yet to be studied. One of these aspects is the characterization of the surface roughness and dimensional precision obtainable in layered manufacturing processes. In this paper, a study of roughness parameters obtained through the use of these manufacturing processes was made. Prototype parts were manufactured using FDM techniques and an experimental analysis of the resulting roughness average (R/sub a/) and rms roughness (R/sub q/) obtained through the use of these manufacturing processes was carried out. Dimensional parameters were also studied in order to determine the capability of the Fused Deposition Modelling process for manufacturing parts", "799": "Electronic reserves at University College London: understanding the needs of academic departments.

High-Performance Fortran (HPF) was envisioned as a vehicle for modernizing legacy Fortran codes to achieve scalable parallel performance. To a large extent, today's commercially available HPF compilers have failed to deliver scalable parallel performance for a broad spectrum of applications because of insufficiently powerful compiler analysis and optimization. Substantial restructuring and hand-optimization can be required to achieve acceptable performance with an HPF port of an existing Fortran application, even for regular data-parallel applications. A key goal of the Rice dHPF compiler project has been to develop optimization techniques that enable a wide range of existing scientific applications to be ported easily to efficient HPF with minimal restructuring. This paper describes the challenges to effective parallelization presented by complex (but regular) data-parallel applications, and then describes how the novel analysis and optimization technologies in the dHPF compiler address these challenges effectively, without major rewriting of the applications. We illustrate the techniques by describing their use for parallelizing the NAS SP and BT benchmarks. The dHPF compiler generates multipartitioned parallelizations of these codes that are approaching the scalability and efficiency of sophisticated hand-coded parallelizations", "1303": "Reply to Carreira-Perpinan and Goodhill [mathematics in biology]. In a paper by Carreira-Perpinan and Goodhill (see ibid., vol.14, no.7, p.1545-60, 2002) the authors apply mathematical arguments to biology. Swindale et al. think it is inappropriate to apply the standards of proof required in mathematics to the acceptance or rejection of scientific hypotheses. To give some examples, showing that data are well described by a linear model does not rule out an infinity of other possible models that might give better descriptions of the data. Proving in a mathematical sense that the linear model was correct would require ruling out all other possible models, a hopeless task. Similarly, to demonstrate that two DNA samples come from the same individual, it is sufficient to show a match between only a few regions of the genome, even though there remains a very large number of additional comparisons that could be done, any one of which might potentially disprove the match.

The use of evolutionary methods to generate controllers for real-world autonomous agents has attracted attention. Most of the pertinent research has employed genetic algorithms or variations thereof. Research has applied an alternative evolutionary method, evolution strategies, to the generation of simple Braitenberg vehicles. This application accelerates the development of such controllers by more than an order of magnitude (a few hours compared to more than two days). Motivated by this useful speedup, the paper investigates the evolution of more complex architectures, receptive-field controllers, that can employ nonlinear interactions and, therefore, can yield more complex behavior. It is interesting to note that the evolution strategy yields the same efficacy in terms of function evaluations, even though the second class of controllers requires up to 10 times more parameters than the simple Braitenberg architecture. In addition to the speedup, there is an important theoretical reason for preferring an evolution strategy over a genetic algorithm for this problem, namely the presence of epistasis", "1182": "Optimization of the memory weighting function in stochastic functional self-organized sorting performed by a team of autonomous mobile agents. The activity of a team of autonomous mobile agents formed by identical \"robot-like-ant\" individuals capable of performing a random walk through an environment that are able to recognize and move different \"objects\" is modeled. The emergent desired behavior is a distributed sorting and clustering based only on local information and a memory register that records the past objects encountered. An optimum weighting function for the memory registers is theoretically derived. The optimum time-dependent weighting function allows sorting and clustering of the randomly distributed objects in the shortest time. By maximizing the average speed of a texture feature (the contrast) we check the central assumption, the intermediate steady-states hypothesis, of our theoretical result. It is proved that the algorithm optimization based on maximum speed variation of the contrast feature gives relationships similar to the theoretically derived annealing law", "1249": "Aggregators versus disintermediators: battling it out in the information superhighstreet.

This paper describes a computationally simple method to perform text independent speaker verification using second order statistics. The suggested method, called utterance level scoring (ULS), allows one to obtain a normalized score using a single pass through the frames of the tested utterance. The utterance sample covariance is first calculated and then compared to the speaker covariance using a distortion measure. Subsequently, a distortion measure between the utterance covariance and the sample covariance of data taken from different speakers is used to normalize the score. Experimental results from the 2000 NIST speaker recognition evaluation are presented for ULS, used with different distortion measures, and for a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) system. The results indicate that ULS as a viable alternative to GMM whenever the computational complexity and verification accuracy needs to be traded", "1221": "An approach to developing computational supports for reciprocal tutoring.

This paper presents a nonlinear, robust control algorithm for accurate positioning of a single degree of freedom rotary manipulator actuated by Shape Memory Alloy (SMA). A model for an SMA actuated manipulator is presented. The model includes nonlinear dynamics of the manipulator, a constitutive model of Shape Memory Alloy, and electrical and heat transfer behavior of SMA wire. This model is used for open and closed loop motion simulations of the manipulator. Experiments are presented that show results similar to both closed and open loop simulation results. Due to modeling uncertainty and nonlinear behavior of the system, classic control methods such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative control are not able to present fast and accurate performance. Hence a nonlinear, robust control algorithm is presented based on Variable Structure Control.

This goal is pursued by adopting linear-in-the-parameters NARX models, for which an identification method is developed based on the minimization of the simulation error. This method is capable of selecting the model structure together with the parameters, thus it does not require a priori structural information.

The C++ Standard states that a union type cannot have a member with a nontrivial constructor or destructor. While at first this seems unreasonable, further thought makes it clear why this is the case: The crux of the problem is that unions don't have built-in semantics for denoting when a member is the \"current\" member of the union. Therefore, the compiler can't know when it's appropriate to call constructors or destructors on the union members. Still, there are good reasons for wanting to use constructed object types in a union. For example, you might want to implement a scripting language with a single variable type that can either be an integer, a string, or a list. A union is the perfect candidate for implementing such a composite type, but the restriction on constructed union members may prevent you from using an existing string or list class (for example, from the STL) to provide the underlying functionality.

The definition of run-time dead code is given and its side effect is discussed. To eliminate the imprecision caused by the run-time dead code, backward data-flow information must be used. Proteus Test, which can use backward information in run-time, is then presented to exploit more dynamic parallelism. Also, a variation of Proteus Test, the Advanced Proteus Test, is offered to achieve partial parallelism. Proteus Test was implemented on the parallelizing compiler AFT.

The people who use computers and the ways they use them have changed substantially over the past 25 years. In the beginning highly educated people, mostly men, in technical professions used computers for work, but over time a much broader range of people are using computers for personal and domestic purposes. This trend is still continuing, and over a shorter time scale has been replicated with the use of the Internet. The paper uses data from four national surveys to document how personal computers and the Internet have become increasingly domesticated since 1995 and to explore the mechanisms for this shift. Now people log on more often from home than from places of employment and do so for pleasure and for personal purposes rather than for their jobs. Analyses comparing veteran Internet users to novices in 1998 and 2000 and analyses comparing the change in use within a single sample between 1995 and 1996 support two complementary explanations for how these technologies have become domesticated. Women, children, and less well-educated individuals are increasingly using computers and the Internet and have a more personal set of motives than well-educated men.

I. Effect-volume histogram. With the advent of dose optimization algorithms, predominantly for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), computer software has progressed beyond the point of being merely a tool at the hands of an expert and has become an active, independent mediator of the dosimetric conflicts between treatment goals and risks. To understand and control the internal decision finding as well as to provide means to influence it, a tool for the analysis of the dose distribution is presented which reveals the decision-making process performed by the algorithm. The internal trade-offs between partial volumes receiving high or low doses are driven by functions which attribute a weight to each volume element. The statistics of the distribution of these weights is cast into an effect-volume histogram (EVH) in analogy to dose-volume histograms. The analysis of the EVH reveals which traits of the optimum dose distribution result from the defined objectives, and which are a random consequence of under- or misspecification of treatment goals. The EVH can further assist in the process of finding suitable objectives and balancing conflicting objectives. If biologically inspired objectives are used, the EVH shows the distribution of local dose effect relative to the prescribed level", "1280": "Products and polymorphic subtypes. This paper is devoted to a comprehensive study of polymorphic subtypes with products. We first present a sound and complete Hilbert style axiomatization of the relation of being a subtype in presence of to , * type constructors and the For all quantifier, and we show that such axiornatization is not encodable in the system with to , For all only. In order to give a logical semantics to such a subtyping relation, we propose a new form of a sequent which plays a key role in a natural deduction and a Gentzen style calculi. Interestingly enough, the sequent must have the form E implies T, where E is a non-commutative, non-empty sequence of typing assumptions and T is a finite binary tree of typing judgements, each of them behaving like a pushdown store. We study basic metamathematical properties of the two logical systems, such as subject reduction and cut elimination.

Tools and results of multivariable statistics are used to show that, under a variety of assumed distributions on the elements, square processes of higher dimension tend to be more difficult to identify and control, whereas the expected controllability and identifiability of nonsquare processes depends on the relative numbers of measured and manipulated variables.

In this paper, extensive tests and comparative analysis are conducted on the feature detection algorithms, using carefully selected components from the public domain, mostly from the National Design Repository. The results show that the new and enhanced algorithms identify face sets that previously published algorithms cannot detect.

This facilitates the identification of the foreground and interfering strokes. A wavelet reconstruction process then iteratively enhances the foreground strokes and smears the interfering strokes so as to strengthen the discriminating capability of an improved Canny edge detector against the interfering strokes.

This paper describes a pattern recognition (PR) technique, which uses learning vector quantization (LVQ). This method is adapted for practical application to solve problems in the area of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis where a number of fault signatures are involved. In these situations, the aim is health monitoring, including identification of deterioration of the healthy condition and identification of causes of the failure in real-time. For this reason a fault database is developed which contains the collected information about various states of operation of the system in the form of pattern vectors. The task of the real-time monitoring system is to correlate patterns of unknown faults with the known fault signatures in the fault database. This will determine cause of failure and degree of deterioration of the system under test. The problem of fault diagnosis may involve a large number of patterns and large sampling time, which affects the learning stage of neural networks. The study here also aims to find a fast learning model of neural networks for instances when a high number of patterns and numerous processing elements are involved.

Analytical phantoms are used to generate projection data for testing reconstruction accuracy in computed axial tomography. A circular source locus (equivalent to rotating specimen with a fixed source) provides insufficient data for 'exact' reconstruction in cone-beam transmission tomography, thus phantom data are useful for studying the consequent errors and also for investigating alternative scanning loci and reconstruction techniques. We present an algorithm that can compute phantom cone-beam projection data from a phantom comprising geometrically defined polyhedra. Each polyhedron is defined as a set of polygons enclosing a volume of fixed linear attenuation coefficient. The algorithm works by projecting each polygon in turn onto the modelled detector array, which accumulates the product of source to polygon intersection distance (for the rays intersecting each detector element), linear attenuation coefficient and sign of projected polygon area (indicating whether rays enter or exit the polyhedron at this face). The phantom data are rotated according to the projection angle, whilst the source location and detector plane remain fixed. Polyhedra can be of simple geometric form, or complex surfaces derived from 3D images of real specimens. This algorithm is illustrated using a phantom comprising 989 238 polygons, representing an iso-surface generated from a microtomographic reconstruction of a piece of walrus tusk", "1207": "Packet spacing: an enabling mechanism for delivering multimedia content in computational grids. Streaming multimedia with UDP has become increasingly popular over distributed systems like the Internet. Scientific applications that stream multimedia include remote computational steering of visualization data and video-on-demand teleconferencing over the Access Grid. However, UDP does not possess a self-regulating, congestion-control mechanism; and most best-effort traffic is served by congestion-controlled TCP. Consequently, UDP steals bandwidth from TCP such that TCP flows starve for network resources. With the volume of Internet traffic continuing to increase, the perpetuation of UDP-based streaming will cause the Internet to collapse as it did in the mid-1980's due to the use of non-congestion-controlled TCP. To address this problem, we introduce the counter-intuitive notion of inter-packet spacing with control feedback to enable UDP-based applications to perform well in the next-generation Internet and computational grids. When compared with traditional UDP-based streaming, we illustrate that our approach can reduce packet loss over 50% without adversely affecting delivered throughput", "1437": "Improving the frequency stability of microwave oscillators by utilizing the dual-mode sapphire-loaded cavity resonator.

The optimized handling of reductions on parallel supercomputers or clusters of workstations is critical to high performance because reductions are common in scientific codes and a potential source of bottlenecks. Yet in many high-level languages, a mechanism for writing efficient reductions remains surprisingly absent. Further, when such mechanisms do exist, they often do not provide the flexibility a programmer needs to achieve a desirable level of performance. In this paper, we present a new language construct for arbitrary reductions that lets a programmer achieve a level of performance equal to that achievable with the highly flexible, but low-level combination of Fortran and MPI. We have implemented this construct in the ZPL language and evaluate it in the context of the initialization of the NAS MG benchmark. We show a 45 times speedup over the same code written in ZPL without this construct. In addition, performance on a large number of processors surpasses that achieved in the NAS implementation showing that our mechanism provides programmers with the needed flexibility", "1458": "Direct gear tooth contact analysis for hypoid bevel gears. A new methodology for tooth contact analysis based on a very general mathematical model of the generating process is proposed. Considering the line of action as a first order singularity of a certain operator equation we develop first and second order conditions for a pair of generated gear tooth flanks to be in contact. The constructive approach allows the direct computation of the paths of contact as the solution of a nonlinear equation system including the exact determination of the bounds of the paths of contact. The transmission error as well as curvature properties in the contact points are obtained in a convenient way. The resulting contact ellipses approximate the bearing area.

Software configuration management (SCM) is an important key technology in software development. Component-based software development (CBSD) is an emerging paradigm in software development. However, to apply CBSD effectively in real world practice, supporting SCM in CBSD needs to be further investigated. In this paper, the objects that need to be managed in CBSD is analyzed and a component-based SCM model is presented. In this model, components, as the integral logical constituents in a system, are managed as the basic configuration items in SCM, and the relationships between/among components are defined and maintained. Based on this model, a configuration management system is implemented", "1177": "Comparative statistical analysis of hole taper and circularity in laser percussion drilling. Investigates the relationships and parameter interactions between six controllable variables on the hole taper and circularity in laser percussion drilling. Experiments have been conducted on stainless steel workpieces and a comparison was made between stainless steel and mild steel. The central composite design was employed to plan the experiments in order to achieve required information with reduced number of experiments. The process performance was evaluated. The ratio of minimum to maximum Feret's diameter was considered as circularity characteristic of the hole. The models of these three process characteristics were developed by linear multiple regression technique. The significant coefficients were obtained by performing analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 1, 5 and 7% levels of significance. The final models were checked by complete residual analysis and finally were experimentally verified. It was found that the pulse frequency had a significant effect on the hole entrance diameter and hole circularity in drilling stainless steel unlike the drilling of mild steel where the pulse frequency had no significant effect on the hole characteristics", "1193": "Operator splitting and approximate factorization for taxis-diffusion-reaction models. In this paper we consider the numerical solution of 2D systems of certain types of taxis-diffusion-reaction equations from mathematical biology. By spatial discretization these PDE systems are approximated by systems of positive, nonlinear ODEs (Method of Lines). The aim of this paper is to examine the numerical integration of these ODE systems for low to moderate accuracy by means of splitting techniques. An important consideration is maintenance of positivity. We apply operator splitting and approximate matrix factorization using low order explicit Runge-Kutta methods and linearly implicit Runge-Kutta-Rosenbrock methods.

Multiresolution analysis (MRA) and wavelets provide useful and efficient tools for representing functions at multiple levels of details. Wavelet representations have been used in a broad range of applications, including image compression, physical simulation and numerical analysis. In this paper, the authors construct a new class of wavelets, called four-point wavelets, based on an interpolatory four-point subdivision scheme. They are of local support, symmetric and stable. The analysis and synthesis algorithms have linear time complexity. Depending on different weight parameters w, the scaling functions and wavelets generated by the four-point subdivision scheme are of different degrees of smoothness. Therefore the user can select better wavelets relevant to the practice among the classes of wavelets. The authors apply the four-point wavelets in signal compression. The results show that the four-point wavelets behave much better than B-spline wavelets in many situations", "1025": "Watermarking techniques for electronic delivery of remote sensing images. Earth observation missions have recently attracted a growing interest, mainly due to the large number of possible applications capable of exploiting remotely sensed data and images. Along with the increase of market potential, the need arises for the protection of the image products. Such a need is a very crucial one, because the Internet and other public/private networks have become preferred means of data exchange. A critical issue arising when dealing with digital image distribution is copyright protection. Such a problem has been largely addressed by resorting to watermarking technology. A question that obviously arises is whether the requirements imposed by remote sensing imagery are compatible with existing watermarking techniques. On the basis of these motivations, the contribution of this work is twofold: assessment of the requirements imposed by remote sensing applications on watermark-based copyright protection, and modification of two well-established digital watermarking techniques to meet such constraints. More specifically, the concept of near-lossless watermarking is introduced and two possible algorithms matching such a requirement are presented. Experimental results are shown to measure the impact of watermark introduction on a typical remote sensing application, i.e., unsupervised image classification", "578": "New approach to standing phase angle reduction for power system restoration. During power system restoration, it is necessary to check the phase angle between two buses before closing circuit breakers to connect a line between them. These angles may occur across a tie line between two systems or between two connected subsystems within a system. In case of large standing phase angle (SPA) difference the synchro-check relay does not allow closing of the breaker for this line. Therefore, this excessive SPA has to be reduced before attempting to connect the line. In this paper, a new and fast method for reducing SPA is presented. For this purpose, the standing phase angle difference between two specific buses is represented in terms of sensitivity factors associated with the change in active power generations and consumption at the buses. Then, the proposed method reschedule generation of selected units or shed load of selected buses to reduce excessive SPA difference between two buses based on sensitivity factors", "552": "Anatomy of the coupling query in a Web warehouse. To populate a data warehouse specifically designed for Web data, i.e. Web warehouse, it is imperative to harness relevant documents from the Web. In this paper, we describe a query mechanism called coupling query to glean relevant Web data in the context of our Web warehousing system called Warehouse Of Web Data (WHOWEDA). A coupling query may be used for querying both HTML and XML documents. Important features of our query mechanism are the ability to query metadata, content, internal and external (hyperlink) structure of Web documents based on partial knowledge, ability to express constraints on tag attributes and tagless segment of data, ability to express conjunctive as well as disjunctive query conditions compactly, ability to control execution of a Web query and preservation of the topological structure of hyperlinked documents in the query results.

The stage order condition is a simplifying assumption that reduces the number of order conditions to be fulfilled when designing a Runge-Kutta (RK) method. Because a DIRK (diagonally implicit RK) method cannot have stage order greater than 1, we introduce quasi stage order conditions and derive some of their properties for DIRKs. We use these conditions to derive a low-order DIRK method with embedded error estimator. Numerical tests with stiff ODEs and DAEs of index 1 and 2 indicate that the method is competitive with other RK methods for low accuracy tolerances", "1146": "Mammogram synthesis using a 3D simulation. I. Breast tissue model and image acquisition simulation. A method is proposed for generating synthetic mammograms based upon simulations of breast tissue and the mammographic imaging process. A computer breast model has been designed with a realistic distribution of large and medium scale tissue structures. Parameters controlling the size and placement of simulated structures (adipose compartments and ducts) provide a method for consistently modeling images of the same simulated breast with modified position or acquisition parameters. The mammographic imaging process is simulated using a compression model and a model of the X-ray image acquisition process. The compression model estimates breast deformation using tissue elasticity parameters found in the literature and clinical force values.

Evaluation of synthetic mammogram texture. We have evaluated a method for synthesizing mammograms by comparing the texture of clinical and synthetic mammograms. The synthesis algorithm is based upon simulations of breast tissue and the mammographic imaging process. Mammogram texture was synthesized by projections of simulated adipose tissue compartments. It was hypothesized that the synthetic and clinical texture have similar properties, assuming that the mammogram texture reflects the 3D tissue distribution. The size of the projected compartments was computed by mathematical morphology. The texture energy and fractal dimension were also computed and analyzed in terms of the distribution of texture features within four different tissue regions in clinical and synthetic mammograms. Comparison of the cumulative distributions of the mean features computed from 95 mammograms showed that the synthetic images simulate the mean features of the texture of clinical mammograms. Correlation of clinical and synthetic texture feature histograms, averaged over all images, showed that the synthetic images can simulate the range of features seen over a large group of mammograms. The best agreement with clinical texture was achieved for simulated compartments with radii of 4-13.3 mm in predominantly adipose tissue regions, and radii of 2.7-5.33 and 1.3-2.7 mm in retroareolar and dense fibroglandular tissue regions, respectively", "59": "Efficient tracking of the cross-correlation coefficient. In many (audio) processing algorithms, involving manipulation of discrete-time signals, the performance can vary strongly over the repertoire that is used. This may be the case when the signals from the various channels are allowed to be strongly positively or negatively correlated. We propose and analyze a general formula for tracking the (time-dependent) correlation between two signals. Some special cases of this formula lead to classical results known from the literature, others are new. This formula is recursive in nature, and uses only the instantaneous values of the two signals, in a low-cost and low-complexity manner; in particular, there is no need to take square roots or to carry out divisions. Furthermore, this formula can be modified with respect to the occurrence of the two signals so as to further decrease the complexity, and increase ease of implementation. The latter modification comes at the expense that not the actual correlation is tracked, but, rather, a somewhat deformed version of it. To overcome this problem, we propose, for a number of instances of the tracking formula, a simple warping operation on the deformed correlation. Now we obtain, at least for sinusoidal signals, the correct value of the correlation coefficient. Special attention is paid to the convergence behavior of the algorithm for stationary signals and the dynamic behavior if there is a transition to another stationary state; the latter is considered to be important to study the tracking abilities to nonstationary signals. We illustrate tracking algorithm by using it for stereo music fragments, obtained from a number of digital audio recordings", "1038": "The analysis and control of longitudinal vibrations from wave viewpoint. The analysis and control of longitudinal vibrations in a rod from feedback wave viewpoint are synthesized. Both collocated and noncollocated feedback wave control strategies are explored.

The influence of pintle pin friction. A brief review of knowledge of car-caravan snaking is carried out. Against the background described, a fairly detailed mathematical model of a contemporary car-trailer system is constructed and a baseline set of parameter values is given. In reduced form, the model is shown to give results in accordance with literature. The properties of the baseline combination are explored using both linear and non-linear versions of the model. The influences of damping at the pintle joint and of several other design parameters on the stability of the linear system in the neighbourhood of the critical snaking speed are calculated and discussed. Coulomb friction damping at the pintle pin is then included and simulations are used to indicate the consequent amplitude-dependent behaviour. The friction damping, especially when its level has to be chosen by the user, is shown to give dangerous characteristics, despite having some capacity for stabilization of the snaking motions. It is concluded that pintle pin friction damping does not represent a satisfactory solution to the snaking problem.

Wave functions of bounded quantum systems with time-independent potentials, being almost periodic functions, cannot have time asymptotics as in classical chaos.

Rates of growth in quantum mechanics are discussed by constructing quantities with the same physical meaning as those involved in the classical Lyapunov exponent. A generalized notion of quantum sensitive dependence is introduced and the mathematical structure of the operator matrix elements that correspond to different types of growth is characterized", "725": "Banks pin their back-office hopes on successors to screen scrapers.

Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are being embedded in or externally attached to smart structures because of the large amount of actuation deformation and force that these materials are capable of producing when they are heated. Previous investigations have focused primarily on using single or opposing SMA wires exhibiting the two-way shape memory effect (SME) because of the simplicity with which the repeatable actuation behavior of the structure can be predicted. This repeatable actuation behavior is achieved at the expense of reduced levels of recoverable deformation. Alternatively, many potential smart structure applications will employ multiple SMA wires exhibiting a permanent one-way SME to simplify fabrication and increase the recoverable strains in the structure. To employ the one-way wires, it is necessary to investigate how they affect the recovery of large strains when they are embedded in a structure. In this investigation, the large strain recovery of a one-way SMA wire embedded in a flexible polyurethane is characterized using the novel deformation measurement technique known as digital image correlation. These results are compared with a simple actuation model and a three-dimensional finite element analysis of the structure using the Brinson model for describing the thermomechanical behavior of the SMA. Results indicate that the level of actuation strain in the structure is substantially reduced by the inelastic behavior of the one-way SMA wires, and there are significant differences between the deformations of the matrix material adjacent to the SMA wires and in the region surrounding it. The transformation behavior of the SMA wires was also determined to be volume preserving, which had a significant effect on the transverse strain fields", "80": "Evaluating the performance of a distributed database of repetitive elements in complete genomes.

The widespread application of ionic hydrogels in a number of applications like control of microfluidic flow, development of muscle-like actuators, filtration/separation and drug delivery makes it important to properly understand these materials. Understanding hydrogel properties is also important from the standpoint of their similarity to many biological tissues. Typically, gel size is sensitive to outer solution pH and salt concentration. In this paper, we develop models to predict the swelling/deswelling of hydrogels in buffered pH solutions. An equilibrium model has been developed to predict the degree of swelling of the hydrogel at a given pH and salt concentration in the solution. A kinetic model has been developed to predict the rate of swelling of the hydrogel when the solution pH is changed. Experiments are performed to characterize the mechanical properties of the hydrogel in different pH solutions. The degree of swelling as well as the rate of swelling of the hydrogel are also studied through experiments. The simulations are compared with experimental results and the models are found to predict the swelling/deswelling processes accurately", "1090": "On the contractivity of implicit-explicit linear multistep methods.

Therefore, using the characteristic of this sliding mode we aim to design a controller that can meet the desired specification and use less control energy by comparing with the result in the current existing literature.

The goal of this study was to determine if virtual reality graded exposure therapy (VRGET) was equally efficacious, more efficacious, or less efficacious, than imaginal exposure therapy in the treatment of fear of flying. Thirty participants (Age=39.8+or-9.7) with confirmed DSM-IV diagnosis of specific phobia fear of flying were randomly assigned to one of three groups: VRGET with no physiological feedback (VRGETno), VRGET with physiological feedback (VRGETpm), or systematic desensitization with imaginal exposure therapy (IET). Eight sessions were conducted once a week. During each session, physiology was measured to give an objective measurement of improvement over the course of exposure therapy. In addition, self-report questionnaires, subjective ratings of anxiety (SUDs), and behavioral observations (included here as flying behavior before beginning treatment and at a three-month posttreatment followup) were included. In the analysis of results, the Chi-square test of behavioral observations based on a three-month posttreatment followup revealed a statistically significant difference in flying behavior between the groups [ chi /sup 2/(4)=19.41, p<0.001]. Only one participant (10%) who received IET, eight of the ten participants (80%) who received VRGETno, and ten out of the ten participants (100%) who received VRGETpm reported an ability to fly without medication or alcohol at three-month followup. Although this study included small sample sizes for the three groups, the results showed VRGET was more effective than IET in the treatment of flying. It also suggests that physiological feedback may add to the efficacy of VR treatment", "707": "Vector algebra proofs for geometry theorems.

This study investigated the application of genetic algorithms in solving a fuzzy optimization problem that arises in business and economics. In this problem, a fuzzy price is determined using a linear or a quadratic fuzzy demand function as well as a linear cost function. The objective is to find the optimal fuzzy profit, which is derived from the fuzzy price and fuzzy cost. Traditional methods for solving this problem are (1) the extension principle, and (2) using interval arithmetic and alpha -cuts. However, we argue that traditional methods for solving this problem are too restrictive to produce an optimal solution, and that an alternative approach is possibly needed. We use genetic algorithms to obtain an approximate solution for this fuzzy optimal profit problem without using membership functions. We not only give empirical examples to show the effectiveness of this approach, but also give theoretical proofs to validate correctness of the algorithm. We conclude that genetic algorithms can produce good approximate solutions when applied to solve fuzzy optimization problems", "1056": "Eliminating recency with self-review: the case of auditors' 'going concern' judgments. This paper examines the use of self-review to debias recency. Recency is found in the 'going concern' judgments of staff auditors, but is successfully eliminated by the auditor's use of a simple self-review technique that would be extremely easy to implement in audit practice. Auditors who self-review are also less inclined to make audit report choices that are inconsistent with their going concern judgments. These results are important because the judgments of staff auditors often determine the type and extent of documentation in audit workpapers and serve as preliminary inputs for senior auditors' judgments and choices. If staff auditors' judgments are affected by recency, the impact of this bias may be impounded in the ultimate judgments and choices of senior auditors. Since biased judgments can expose auditors to significant costs involving extended audit procedures, legal liability and diminished reputation, simple debiasing techniques that reduce this exposure are valuable.

In this paper, we propose a robust self-tuning PID controller suitable for nonlinear systems. The control system employs a preload relay (P_Relay) in series with a PID controller. The P_Relay ensures a high gain to yield a robust performance. However, it also incurs a chattering phenomenon. In this paper, instead of viewing the chattering as an undesirable yet inevitable feature, we use it as a naturally occurring signal for tuning and re-tuning the PID controller as the operating regime digresses. No other explicit input signal is required. Once the PID controller is tuned for a particular operating point, the relay may be disabled and chattering ceases correspondingly. However, it is invoked when there is a change in setpoint to another operating regime. In this way, the approach is also applicable to time-varying systems as the PID tuning can be continuous, based on the latest set of chattering characteristics.

We extend this test to the more general situation where the zero probability is allowed to depend on covariates. The performance of this test is evaluated using a simulation study. To identify potentially important covariates in the zero-inflation model a composite test is proposed. The use of the general score test and the composite procedure is illustrated on two examples from the literature.

Each iteration of the randomized algorithm for the ASN involves the following two phases: (1) generation of random cuts using a multidimensional Ber(p) distribution and calculation of the associated cut lengths (objective functions) and some related quantities, such as rare-event probabilities; (2) updating the parameter vector p on the basis of the data collected in the first phase. We show that the Ber(p) distribution converges in distribution to a degenerated one, Ber(p/sub d/*), p/sub d/* = (p/sub d/,/sub 1/, p/sub d,n/) in the sense that some elements of p/sub d/*, will be unities and the rest zeros. The unity elements of p/sub d/* uniquely define a cut which will be taken as the estimate of the maximal cut. A similar approach is used for the partition problem. Supporting numerical results are given as well. Our numerical studies suggest that for the maximal cut and partition problems the proposed algorithm typically has polynomial complexity in the size of the network", "604": "SRP rolls out reliability and asset management initiative. Reliability planning analysis at the Salt River Project (SRP, Tempe, Arizona, US) prioritizes geographic areas for preventive inspections based on a cost benefit model. However, SRP wanted a new application system to prioritize inspections and to predict when direct buried cable would fail using the same cost benefit model. In the business cases, the represented type of kilowatt load-residential, commercial or critical circuit-determines the cost benefit per circuit. The preferred solution was to develop a geographical information system (GIS) application allowing for a circuit query for the specific geographic areas it crosses and the density of load points of a given type within those areas. The query returns results based on the type of equipment analysis execution: wood pole, preventive maintenance for a line or cable replacement. This differentiation insures that all the facilities relevant to a specific analysis type influence prioritization of the geographic areas", "615": "An intelligent tutoring system for a power plant simulator. In this paper, an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) is proposed for a power plant simulator. With a well designed ITS, the need for an instructor is minimized and the operator may readily and efficiently take, in real-time, the control of simulator with appropriate messages he(she) gets from the tutoring system.

Presents a new pathline approach, based on the wavefront propagation principle, and developed in order to reduce the variability in the outcomes of the quantitative coronary artery analysis. This novel approach, called wavepath, reduces the influence of the user-defined start- and endpoints of the vessel segment and is therefore more robust and improves the reproducibility of the lesion quantification substantially. The validation study shows that the wavepath method is totally constant in the middle part of the pathline, even when using the method for constructing a bifurcation or sidebranch pathline. Furthermore, the number of corrections needed to guide the wavepath through the correct vessel is decreased from an average of 0.44 corrections per pathline to an average of 0.12 per pathline. Therefore, it can be concluded that the wavepath algorithm improves the overall analysis substantially", "766": "Physical quantum algorithms.

The aim was to evaluate translation of chest radiographic reports using natural language processing and to compare the findings with those in the literature. A natural language processor coded 10 years of narrative chest radiographic reports from an urban academic medical center. Coding for 150 reports was compared with manual coding. Frequencies and cooccurrences of 24 clinical conditions (diseases, abnormalities, and clinical states) were estimated. The ratio of right to left lung mass, association of pleural effusion with other conditions, and frequency of bullet and stab wounds were compared with independent observations.

We offer storage and intelligent workflow.\" The United States military - especially during war time - is pretty careful about the way it handles its workflow and communications. Before a company is awarded a government contract, the company and its technology are screened and verified. If the technology or its creators aren't trustworthy and secure, chances are they aren't getting by Uncle Sam. Record companies and publishing houses tend to feel the same way. After all, security is just as important to a record executive as it is to a Navy commander. WAM!Net, a Wide-Area Media network (hence, the name) passes muster with both. The company, which employs about 320 employees around the world, has 15000 customers including the US Navy and a host of record labels, publishing companies, healthcare providers, and advertising agencies, all of whom use its network as a way to transport, store, and receive data. \"We are the digital version of FedEx.

We introduce and analyze a scalable rekeying scheme for implementing secure group communications Internet protocol multicast. We show that our scheme incurs constant processing, message, and storage overhead for a rekey operation when a single member joins or leaves the group, and logarithmic overhead for bulk simultaneous changes to the group membership. These bounds hold even when group dynamics are not known a priori. Our rekeying algorithm requires a particular clustering of the members of the secure multicast group. We describe a protocol to achieve such clustering and show that it is feasible to efficiently cluster members over realistic Internet-like topologies. We evaluate the overhead of our own rekeying scheme and also of previously published schemes via simulation over an Internet topology map containing over 280 000 routers. Through analysis and detailed simulations, we show that this rekeying scheme performs better than previous schemes for a single change to group membership. Further, for bulk group changes, our algorithm outperforms all previously known schemes by several orders of magnitude in terms of actual bandwidth usage, processing costs, and storage requirements", "730": "Multi-hour design of survivable classical IP networks. Most of Internet intra-domain routing protocols (OSPF, RIP, and IS-IS) are based on shortest path routing. The path length is defined as the sum of metrics associated with the path links. These metrics are often managed by the network administrator. In this context, the design of an Internet backbone network consists in dimensioning the network (routers and transmission links) and establishing the metric. Many requirements have to be satisfied. First, Internet traffic is not static as significant variations can be observed during the day. Second, many failures can occur (cable cuts, hardware failures, software failures, etc.). We present algorithms (meta-heuristics and greedy heuristic) to design Internet backbone networks, taking into account the multi-hour behaviour of traffic and some survivability requirements. Many multi-hour and protection strategies are studied and numerically compared. Our algorithms can be extended to integrate other quality of service constraints", "1086": "Some recent advances in validated methods for IVPs for ODEs. Compared to standard numerical methods for initial value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), validated methods (often called interval methods) for IVPs for ODEs have two important advantages: if they return a solution to a problem, then (1) the problem is guaranteed to have a unique solution, and (2) an enclosure of the true solution is produced. We present a brief overview of interval Taylor series (ITS) methods for IVPs for ODEs and discuss some recent advances in the theory of validated methods for IVPs for ODEs. In particular, we discuss an interval Hermite-Obreschkoff (IHO) scheme for computing rigorous bounds on the solution of an IVP for an ODE, the stability of ITS and IHO methods, and a new perspective on the wrapping effect, where we interpret the problem of reducing the wrapping effect as one of finding a more stable scheme for advancing the solution", "1456": "Look who's talking [voice recognition].

Higher-order languages such as Haskell encourage the programmer to build abstractions by composing functions. A good compiler must inline many of these calls to recover an efficiently executable program. In principle, inlining is dead simple: just replace the call of a function by an instance of its body. But any compiler-writer will tell you that inlining is a black art, full of delicate compromises that work together to give good performance without unnecessary code bloat. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to articulate the key lessons we learned from a full-scale \"production\" inliner, the one used in the Glasgow Haskell compiler.

Although Java and its GUI library Swing provide software developers with a highly customizable framework for creating truly \"international\" applications, the Swing library is not sensitive to locale switches: it cannot automatically change an application's appearance to conform to the conventions of a specific locale at run time. Several types of applications benefit from the ability to easily switch the language at run time. Training applications and other programs that run on computers in public spaces (such as libraries, airports, or government offices) may need to support multiple languages. Other applications (like travel dictionaries or translation programs) are inherently multilingual and are specifically designed to support users of dissimilar tongues. Such applications would greatly benefit if the user-interface language could be customized at run time. The article shows you how to customize Swing to support locale switching at run time.

This new look-and-feel extends the standard Metal look-and-feel but is locale-sensitive at run time", "969": "Controlled projective synchronization in nonpartially-linear chaotic systems. Projective synchronization (PS), in which the state vectors synchronize up to a scaling factor, is usually observable only in partially linear systems.

Performance of PS may also be manipulated by controlling the scaling factor to any desired value. In numerical experiments, we illustrate the applications to a Rossler system and a Chua's circuit.

Interest in the flow of liquids and its measurement can be traced back to early studies by the Egyptians, the Chinese and the Romans. Since these early times the science of flow measurement has undergone a massive change but during the last 25 years or so (1977-2002) it has matured enormously. One of the principal reasons for this is that higher accuracies and reliabilities have been demanded by industry in the measurement of fiscal transfers and today there is vigorous interest in the subject from both the flowmeter manufacturer and user viewpoints. This interest is coupled with the development of advanced computer techniques in fluid mechanics together with the application of increasingly sophisticated electronics", "905": "Ultra-high speed positioning control of a gravure engraving unit using a discrete-time two-degree-of-freedom H/sub infinity / control.

Thus, feedback control is required to achieve good performance. We develop a control design method to achieve both high-speed and high-precision response for piezoelectric actuators using the discrete-time H/sub infinity / control method and the two-degree-of-freedom control scheme. The effectiveness of our proposed method has been shown by simulation and experimental results.

In a recent paper on semidefinite linear complementarity problems, Gowda and Song (2000) introduced and studied the P-property, P/sub 2/-property, GUS-property, and strong monotonicity property for linear transformation L: S/sup n/ to S/sup n/, where S/sup n/ is the space of all symmetric and real n * n matrices. In an attempt to characterize the P/sub 2/-property, they raised the following two questions: (i) Does the strong monotonicity imply the P/sub 2/-property? (ii) Does the GUS-property imply the P/sub 2/-property? In this paper, we show that the strong monotonicity property implies the P/sub 2/-property for any linear transformation and describe an equivalence between these two properties for Lyapunov and other transformations. We show by means of an example that the GUS-property need not imply the P/sub 2/-property, even for Lyapunov transformations", "803": "The mutual effects of grid and wind turbine voltage stability control.

Then, an intelligent optimal sieve is constructed, which predicts the impacts of each output candidate on a power system and sieves out an optimal output from all of the candidates. The artificial neural network technologies and fuzzy methods are applied to build the intelligent sieve. Finally, the real control signal of FACTS devices is calculated according to the selected optimal output through inverse system method. Simulation has been done on a three-machine power system and the results show that the proposed IOSC controller can effectively attenuate system oscillations and enhance the power system transient stability", "1273": "Towards an ontology of approximate reason. This article introduces structural aspects in an ontology of approximate reason. The basic assumption in this ontology is that approximate reason is a capability of an agent. Agents are designed to classify information granules derived from sensors that respond to stimuli in the environment of an agent or received from other agents. Classification of information granules is carried out in the context of parameterized approximation spaces and a calculus of granules. Judgment in agents is a faculty of thinking about (classifying) the particular relative to decision rules derived from data. Judgment in agents is reflective, but not in the classical philosophical sense (e.g., the notion of judgment in Kant). In an agent, a reflective judgment itself is an assertion that a particular decision rule derived from data is applicable to an object (input). That is, a reflective judgment by an agent is an assertion that a particular vector of attribute (sensor) values matches to some degree the conditions for a particular rule. In effect, this form of judgment is an assertion that a vector of sensor values reflects a known property of data expressed by a decision rule. Since the reasoning underlying a reflective judgment is inductive and surjective (not based on a priori conditions or universals), this form of judgment is reflective, but not in the sense of Kant. Unlike Kant, a reflective judgment is surjective in the sense that it maps experimental attribute values onto the most closely matching descriptors (conditions) in a derived rule. Again, unlike Kant's notion of judgment, a reflective judgment is not the result of searching for a universal that pertains to a particular set of values of descriptors. Rather, a reflective judgment by an agent is a form of recognition that a particular vector of sensor values pertains to a particular rule in some degree. This recognition takes the form of an assertion that a particular descriptor vector is associated with a particular decision rule. These considerations can be repeated for other forms of classifiers besides those defined by decision rules", "1355": "Comparison of push and pull systems with transporters: a metamodelling approach.

The study uses metamodels to compare the two systems.

This technique enables us to measure detailed QoS information for individual users, applications and organizations, in a scalable and lightweight manner. In this paper, we present the mathematical foundation of CoMPACT Monitor.

We show that).(G) can be efficiently evaluated and that its determination allows one to reduce the hard problem of computing a minimum clique-cover of a graph to an identical problem of smaller size and special structure.

Class hierarchies form the backbone of many implemented knowledge representation and reasoning systems. They are used for inheritance, classification and transitive closure reasoning. Part hierarchies are also important in artificial intelligence. Other hierarchies, e.g. containment hierarchies, have received less attention in artificial intelligence. This paper presents an architecture and an implementation of a hierarchy reasoner that integrates a class hierarchy, a part hierarchy, and a containment hierarchy into one structure. In order to make an implemented reasoner useful, it needs to operate at least at speeds comparable to human reasoning. As real-world hierarchies are always large, special techniques need to be used to achieve this. We have developed a set of parallel algorithms and a data representation called maximally reduced tree cover for that purpose. The maximally reduced tree cover is an improvement of a materialized transitive closure representation which has appeared in the literature. Our experiments with a medical vocabulary show that transitive closure reasoning for combined class/part/containment hierarchies in near constant time is possible for a fixed hardware configuration", "1385": "Cache invalidation and replacement strategies for location-dependent data in mobile environments. Mobile location-dependent information services (LDISs) have become increasingly popular in recent years. However, data caching strategies for LDISs have thus far received little attention. In this paper, we study the issues of cache invalidation and cache replacement for location-dependent data under a geometric location model. We introduce a new performance criterion, called caching efficiency, and propose a generic method for location-dependent cache invalidation strategies. In addition, two cache replacement policies, PA and PAID, are proposed. Unlike the conventional replacement policies, PA and PAID take into consideration the valid scope area of a data value. We conduct a series of simulation experiments to study the performance of the proposed caching schemes. The experimental results show that the proposed location-dependent invalidation scheme is very effective and the PA and PAID policies significantly outperform the conventional replacement policies", "1008": "Quadratic programming algorithms for large-scale model predictive control. Quadratic programming (QP) methods are an important element in the application of model predictive control (MPC).

In this study, we tailor and apply a new QP method, called QPSchur, to large MPC applications, such as cross directional control problems in paper machines. Written in C++, QPSchur is an object oriented implementation of a novel dual space, Schur complement algorithm. We compare this approach to three widely applied QP algorithms and show that QPSchur is significantly more efficient (up to two orders of magnitude) than the other algorithms. In addition, detailed simulations are considered that demonstrate the importance of the flexible, object oriented construction of QPSchur, along with additional features for constraint handling, warm starts and partial solution", "1139": "Development and evaluation of a case-based reasoning classifier for prediction of breast biopsy outcome with BI-RADS/sup TM/ lexicon. Approximately 70-85% of breast biopsies are performed on benign lesions. To reduce this high number of biopsies performed on benign lesions, a case-based reasoning (CBR) classifier was developed to predict biopsy results from BI-RADS/sup TM/ findings. We used 1433 (931 benign) biopsy-proven mammographic cases. CBR similarity was defined using either the Hamming or Euclidean distance measure over case features. Ten features represented each case: calcification distribution, calcification morphology, calcification number, mass margin, mass shape, mass density, mass size, associated findings, special cases, and age. Performance was evaluated using Round Robin sampling, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, and bootstrap. To determine the most influential features for the CBR, an exhaustive feature search was performed over all possible feature combinations (1022) and similarity thresholds. Influential features were defined as the most frequently occurring features in the feature subsets with the highest partial ROC areas (/sub 0.90/AUC). For CBR with Hamming distance, the most influential features were found to be mass margin, calcification morphology, age, calcification distribution, calcification number, and mass shape, resulting in an /sub 0.90/AUC of 0.33. At 95% sensitivity, the Hamming CBR would spare from biopsy 34% of the benign lesions. At 98% sensitivity, the Hamming CBR would spare 27% benign lesions. For the CBR with Euclidean distance, the most influential feature subset consisted of mass margin, calcification morphology, age, mass density, and associated findings, resulting in /sub 0.90/AUC of 0.37. At 95% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare from biopsy 41% benign lesions. At 98% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare 27% benign lesions. The profile of cases spared by both distance measures at 98% sensitivity indicates that the CBR is a potentially useful diagnostic tool for the classification of mammographic lesions, by recommending short-term follow-up for likely benign lesions that is in agreement with final biopsy results and mammographer's intuition", "655": "Mapping CCF to MARC21: an experimental approach. The purpose of this article is to raise and address a number of issues pertaining to the conversion of Common Communication Format (CCF) into MARC21. In this era of global resource sharing, exchange of bibliographic records from one system to another is imperative in today's library communities. Instead of using a single standard to create machine-readable catalogue records, more than 20 standards have emerged and are being used by different institutions. Because of these variations in standards, sharing of resources and transfer of data from one system to another among the institutions locally and globally has become a significant problem. Addressing this problem requires keeping in mind that countries such as India and others in southeast Asia are using the CCF as a standard for creating bibliographic cataloguing records. This paper describes a way to map the bibliographic catalogue records from CCF to MARC21, although 100% mapping is not possible. In addition, the paper describes an experimental approach that enumerates problems that may occur during the mapping of records/exchanging of records and how these problems can be overcome", "613": "Comparison between discrete STFT and wavelets for the analysis of power quality events.

We present the concept of network traffic streams and the ways they aggregate into flows through Internet links. We describe a method of measuring the size and lifetime of Internet streams, and use this method to characterize traffic distributions at two different sites. We find that although most streams (about 45 percent of them) are dragonflies, lasting less than 2 seconds, a significant number of streams have lifetimes of hours to days, and can carry a high proportion (50-60 percent) of the total bytes on a given link. We define tortoises as streams that last longer than 15 minutes. We point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime (dragonflies and tortoises) but also by size (mice and elephants), and note that stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions. We submit that ISPs need to be aware of the distribution of Internet stream sizes, and the impact of the difference in behavior between short and long streams. In particular, any forwarding cache mechanisms in Internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short streams. In addition ISPs should realize that long-running streams can contribute a significant fraction of their packet and byte volumes-something they may not have allowed for when using traditional \"flat rate user bandwidth consumption\" approaches to provisioning and engineering", "1111": "The contiguity in R/M.

A smoke simulation approach based on the integration of traditional particle systems and density functions is presented in this paper. By attaching a density function to each particle as its attribute, the diffusion of smoke can be described by the variation of particles' density functions, along with the effect on airflow by controlling particles' movement and fragmentation. In addition, a continuous density field for realistic rendering can be generated quickly through the look-up tables of particle's density functions. Compared with traditional particle systems, this approach can describe smoke diffusion, and provide a continuous density field for realistic rendering with much less computation.

Cortical neurons in vivo undergo a continuous bombardment due to synaptic activity, which acts as a major source of noise. We investigate the effects of the noise filtering by synapses with various levels of realism on integrate-and-fire neuron dynamics. The noise input is modeled by white (for instantaneous synapses) or colored (for synapses with a finite relaxation time) noise. Analytical results for the modulation of firing probability in response to an oscillatory input current are obtained by expanding a Fokker-Planck equation for small parameters of the problem-when both the amplitude of the modulation is small compared to the background firing rate and the synaptic time constant is small compared to the membrane time constant. We report the detailed calculations showing that if a synaptic decay time constant is included in the synaptic current model, the firing-rate modulation of the neuron due to an oscillatory input remains finite in the high-frequency limit with no phase lag. In addition, we characterize the low-frequency behavior and the behavior of the high-frequency limit for intermediate decay times. We also characterize the effects of introducing a rise time to the synaptic currents and the presence of several synaptic receptors with different kinetics. In both cases, we determine, using numerical simulations, an effective decay time constant that describes the neuronal response completely", "588": "An accurate COG defuzzifier design using Lamarckian co-adaptation of learning and evolution. This paper proposes a design technique of optimal center of gravity (COG) defuzzifier using the Lamarckian co-adaptation of learning and evolution. The proposed COG defuzzifier is specified by various design parameters such as the centers, widths, and modifiers of MFs. The design parameters are adjusted with the Lamarckian co-adaptation of learning and evolution, where the learning performs a local search of design parameters in an individual COG defuzzifier, but the evolution performs a global search of design parameters among a population of various COG defuzzifiers. This co-adaptation scheme allows to evolve much faster than the non-learning case and gives a higher possibility of finding an optimal solution due to its wider searching capability.

This study focuses on the analysis of group scheduling heuristics in a dual-constrained, automated manufacturing cell, where labour utilization is limited to setups, tear-downs and loads/unloads. This scenario is realistic in today's automated manufacturing cells. The results indicate that policies for allocating labour to tasks have very little impact in such an environment. Furthermore, the performance of efficiency oriented, exhaustive, group scheduling heuristics deteriorated while the performance of the more complex, non-exhaustive heuristics improved. Thus, it is recommended that production managers use the simplest labour scheduling policy, and instead focus their efforts to activities such as job scheduling and production planning in such environments", "998": "Discreteness and relevance: a reply to Roman Poznanski.

Eliasmith hopes that it is evident that he does not claim that the process in neural systems is discrete, but rather that a complete characterization of the process can be discrete; these of course are significantly different claims", "90": "LAN-based building maintenance and surveillance robot. The building and construction industry is the major industry of Hong Kong as in many developed countries around the world. After the commissioning of a high-rise building or a large estate, substantial manpower, both inside the management centre under a standby manner, as well as surveillance for security purposes around the whole building, is required for daily operation to ensure a quality environment for the occupants. If the surveillance job can be done by robots, the efficiency can be highly enhanced, resulting in a great saving of manpower and the improved safety of the management staff as a by-product. Furthermore, if the robot can retrieve commands from the building management system via a local area network (LAN), further savings in manpower can be achieved in terms of first-line fault attendance by human management staff. This paper describes the development of a robot prototype here in Hong Kong, which can handle some daily routine maintenance works and surveillance responsibilities. The hardware structure of the robot and its on-board devices are described. Real-time images captured by a camera on the robot with pan/tilt/zoom functions can be transmitted back to the central management office via a local area network. The interface between the robot and the building automation system (BAS) of the building is discussed. This is the first key achievement of this project with a strong implication on reducing the number of human staff to manage a modem building. Teleoperation of the robot via the Internet or intranet is also possible, which is the second achievement of this project. Finally, the robot can identify its physical position inside the building by a landmark recognition method based on standard CAD drawings, which is the third achievement of this project. The main goal of this paper is not the description of some groundbreaking technology in robotic development. It is mainly intended to convince building designers and managers to incorporate robotic systems when they are managing modem buildings to save manpower and improve efficiency", "1103": "New age computing [autonomic computing].

We discuss a fully automatic technique for extracting roads in urban environments. The method has its bases in a vegetation mask derived from multispectral IKONOS data and in texture derived from panchromatic IKONOS data. These two techniques together are used to distinguish road pixels. We then move from individual pixels to an object-based representation that allows reasoning on a higher level. Recognition of individual segments and intersections and the relationships among them are used to determine underlying road structure and to then logically hypothesize the existence of additional road network components. We show results on an image of San Diego, California. The object-based processing component may be adapted to utilize other basis techniques as well, and could be used to build a road network in any scene having a straight-line structured topology", "831": "Software vendors' failure fuels consolidation theories [telecom interconnection and billing].

Bad pixels are defined as those pixels showing a temporal evolution of the signal different from the rest of the pixels of a given array. Principal component analysis helps us to understand the definition of a statistical distance associated with each pixels, and using this distance it is possible to identify those pixels labeled as bad pixels. The spatiality of a pixel is also calculated. An assumption about the normality of the distribution of the distances of the pixels is revised. Although the influence on the robustness of the identification algorithm is negligible, the definition of a parameter related with this nonnormality helps to identify those principal components and eigenimages responsible for the departure from a multinormal distribution. The method for identifying the bad pixels is successfully applied to a set of frames obtained from a CCD visible and a focal plane array (FPA) IR camera", "1192": "Construction of two-sided bounds for initial-boundary value problems.

A theorem by Hadamard gives a two-part condition under which a map from one Banach space to another is a homeomorphism.

Here, under a typically weak additional assumption on the map, we show that Hadamard's condition is met if, and only if, the map is a homeomorphism with a Lipschitz continuous inverse.

Detection of change-points in normal means is a well-studied problem. The parallel problem of detecting changes in variance has had less attention.

In this paper, we formulate the change-point problem for a sequence of chi-square random variables. We describe a procedure that is exact for the distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic for all even degrees of freedom, and gives upper and lower bounds for odd (and also for non-integer) degrees of freedom. Both the liberal and conservative bounds for chi /sub 1//sup 2/ degrees of freedom are shown through simulation to be reasonably tight. The important problem of testing for change in the normal variance of individual observations corresponds to the chi /sub 1//sup 2/ case.

The Health Level Seven (HL7), an international standard for electronic data exchange in all health care environments, enables disparate computer applications to exchange key sets of clinical and administrative information. Above all, it defines the standard HL7 message formats prescribed by the standard encoding rules. In this paper, we propose a flexible, reusable, and extensible HL7 encoding and decoding framework using a message object model (MOM) and message definition repository (MDR). The MOM provides an abstract HL7 message form represented by a group of objects and their relationships. It reflects logical relationships among the standard HL7 message elements such as segments, fields, and components, while enforcing the key structural constraints imposed by the standard. Since the MOM completely eliminates the dependency of the HL7 encoder and decoder on platform-specific data formats, it makes it possible to build the encoder and decoder as reusable standalone software components, enabling the interconnection of arbitrary heterogeneous hospital information systems (HIS) with little effort. Moreover, the MDR, an external database of key definitions for HL7 messages, helps make the encoder and decoder as resilient as possible to future modifications of the standard HL7 message formats. It is also used by the encoder and decoder to perform a well-formedness check for their respective inputs (i.e., HL7 message objects expressed in the MOM and encoded HL7 message strings). Although we implemented a prototype version of the encoder and decoder using JAVA, they can be easily packaged and delivered as standalone components using the standard component frameworks", "1226": "Temp IT chief rallies troops [Mori].

The idea is to construct the neural-fuzzy system with a two-phase hybrid learning algorithm, which utilizes a CPN-based nearest-neighbor clustering scheme for both structure learning and initial parameters setting, and a gradient descent method with adaptive learning rate for fine tuning the parameters. The obtained network can be used in the same way as a CPN to model and control dynamic systems, while it has a faster learning speed than the original back-propagation algorithm.

As the need for information storage media with high storage density increases, digital video disks (DVDs) with smaller recording marks and thinner optical disk substrates than those of conventional DVDs are being required. Therefore, improving the replication quality of land-groove or pit structure and reducing the birefringence distribution are emerging as important criteria in the fabrication of high-density optical disk substrates. We control the transcribability and distribution of birefringence by inserting an insulation layer under the stamper during injection-compression molding of DVD RAM substrates. The effects of the insulation layer on the geometrical and optical properties, such as transcribability and birefringence distribution, are examined experimentally. The inserted insulation layer is found to be very effective in improving the quality of replication and leveling out the first peak of the gapwise birefringence distribution near the mold wall and reducing the average birefringence value, because the insulation layer retarded the growth of the solidified layer", "1081": "Stability of W-methods with applications to operator splitting and to geometric theory.

Since W-methods treat the term with A implicitly, whereas the term involving B is discretized in an explicit way, they can be regarded as splitting methods.

Active control is an effective method for making two identical Rossler and Chen systems be synchronized. However, this method works only for a certain class of chaotic systems with known parameters both in drive systems and response systems. Modification based on Lyapunov stability theory is proposed in order to overcome this limitation. An adaptive synchronization controller, which can make the states of two identical Rossler and Chen systems globally asymptotically synchronized in the presence of system's unknown constant parameters, is derived. Especially, when some unknown parameters are positive, we can make the controller more simple, besides, the controller is independent of those positive uncertain parameters. At last, when the condition that arbitrary unknown parameters in two systems are identical constants is cancelled, we demonstrate that it is possible to synchronize two chaotic systems. All results are proved using a well-known Lyapunov stability theorem. Numerical simulations are given to validate the proposed synchronization approach", "887": "Towards strong stability of concurrent repetitive processes sharing resources. The paper presents a method for design of stability conditions of concurrent, repetitive processes sharing common resources. Steady-state behaviour of the system with m cyclic processes utilising a resource with the mutual exclusion is considered. Based on a recurrent equations framework necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of maximal performance steady-state are presented. It was shown that if the conditions hold then the m-process system is marginally stable, i.e., a steady-state of the system depends on the perturbations. The problem of finding the relative positions of the processes leading to waiting-free (maximal efficiency) steady-states of the system is formulated as a constraint logic programming problem. An example illustrating the solving of the problem for a 3-process system using object-oriented, constraint logic programming language Oz is presented. A condition sufficient for strong stability of the m-process system is given.

Volumes reconstructed by standard methods from single-slice helical computed tomography (CT) data have been shown to have noise levels that are highly nonuniform relative to those in conventional CT. These noise nonuniformities can affect low-contrast object detectability and have also been identified as the cause of the zebra artifacts that plague maximum intensity projection (MIP) images of such volumes. While these spatially variant noise levels have their root in the peculiarities of the helical scan geometry, there is also a strong dependence on the interpolation and reconstruction algorithms employed. In this paper, we seek to develop image reconstruction strategies that eliminate or reduce, at its source, the nonuniformity of noise levels in helical CT relative to that in conventional CT. We pursue two approaches, independently and in concert. We argue, and verify, that Fourier-based longitudinal interpolation approaches lead to more uniform noise ratios than do the standard 360LI and 180LI approaches. We also demonstrate that a Fourier-based fan-to-parallel rebinning algorithm, used as an alternative to fanbeam filtered backprojection for slice reconstruction, also leads to more uniform noise ratios, even when making use of the 180LI and 360LI interpolation approaches", "1320": "Securing the Internet routing infrastructure. The unprecedented growth of the Internet over the last years, and the expectation of an even faster increase in the numbers of users and networked systems, resulted in the Internet assuming its position as a mass communication medium. At the same time, the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance, or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols, with a variety of countermeasures, which, nonetheless, have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure.

The purpose of this work is to examine physical radiation dose differences between two multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf widths (5 and 10 mm) in the treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Three clinical patients with CNS tumors were planned with two different MLC leaf sizes, 5 and 10 mm, representing Varian-120 and Varian-80 Millennium multileaf collimators, respectively. Two sets of IMRT treatment plans were developed. The goal of the first set was radiation dose conformality in three dimensions. The goal for the second set was organ avoidance of a nearby critical structure while maintaining adequate coverage of the target volume. Treatment planning utilized the CadPlan/Helios system (Varian Medical Systems, Milpitas CA) for dynamic MLC treatment delivery. All beam parameters and optimization (cost function) parameters were identical for the 5 and 10 mm plans. For all cases the number of beams, gantry positions, and table positions were taken from clinically treated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans. Conformality was measured by the ratio of the planning isodose volume to the target volume. Organ avoidance was measured by the volume of the critical structure receiving greater than 90% of the prescription dose (V/sub 90/). For three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (T2-T4 N0-N2c M0) 5 and 10 mm leaf widths were compared for parotid preservation utilizing nine coplanar equally spaced beams delivering a simultaneous integrated boost. Because modest differences in physical dose to the parotid were detected, a NTCP model based upon the clinical parameters of Eisbruch et al. was then used for comparisons. The conformality improved in all three CNS cases for the 5 mm plans compared to the 10 mm plans. For the organ avoidance plans, V/sub 90/ also improved in two of the three cases when the 5 mm leaf width was utilized for IMRT treatment delivery. In the third case, both the 5 and 10 mm plans were able to spare the critical structure with none of the structure receiving more than 90% of the prescription dose, but in the moderate dose range, less dose was delivered to the critical structure with the 5 mm plan. For the head and neck cases both the 5 and 10*2.5 mm beamlets dMLC sliding window techniques spared the contralateral parotid gland while maintaining target volume coverage. The mean parotid dose was modestly lower with the smaller beamlet size (21.04 Gy vs 22.36 Gy). The resulting average NTCP values were 13.72% for 10 mm dMLC and 8.24% for 5 mm dMLC. In conclusion, five mm leaf width results in an improvement in physical dose distribution over 10 mm leaf width that may be clinically relevant in some cases. These differences may be most pronounced for single fraction radiosurgery or in cases where the tolerance of the sensitive organ is less than or close to the target volume prescription", "1253": "Application of XML for neural network exchange.

Time-resolved contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography (MRA) methods have gained in popularity but are still limited by the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution. A method is presented that greatly reduces this tradeoff by employing undersampled 3D projection reconstruction trajectories. The variable density k-space sampling intrinsic to this sequence is combined with temporal k-space interpolation to provide time frames as short as 4 s. This time resolution reduces the need for exact contrast timing while also providing dynamic information. Spatial resolution is determined primarily by the projection readout resolution and is thus isotropic across the FOV, which is also isotropic. Although undersampling the outer regions of k-space introduces aliased energy into the image, which may compromise resolution, this is not a limiting factor in high-contrast applications such as MRA.

This paper presents JASE, a Java-based Agent-oriented and Service-oriented Environment for deploying dynamic distributed systems. JASE utilizes two important concepts in the field of distributed computing: the concept of services and remote programming with mobile agents. In JASE, mobile agents are used to support applications, and service interface agents are used to wrap services. Service inter-face agents can dynamically register their services in Service Server. Mobile agent locates a specific service interface agent by submitting requests to the Service Server with descriptions of required services. JASE uses XML to describe both service descriptions and the mobile agent's queries. JASE supports two kinds of communication facility: tuple space and asynchronous messages. In this paper, the design and implementation of JASE are described. An application shows the suitability and the effectiveness of the JASE and performance evaluation is also made. Finally, related work and some conclusions are given", "945": "Testing statistical bounds on entanglement using quantum chaos. Previous results indicate that while chaos can lead to substantial entropy production, thereby maximizing dynamical entanglement, this still falls short of maximality. Random matrix theory modeling of composite quantum systems, investigated recently, entails a universal distribution of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices. We demonstrate that these distributions are realized in quantized chaotic systems by using a model of two coupled and kicked tops. We derive an explicit statistical universal bound on entanglement, which is also valid for the case of unequal dimensionality of the Hilbert spaces involved, and show that this describes well the bounds observed using composite quantized chaotic systems such as coupled tops", "1333": "The crossing number of P(N, 3).

The main goal of this paper is to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of a virtual-reality (VR)-based multidimensional approach in the treatment of body image attitudes and related constructs. The female binge eating disorder (BED) patients (n=20), involved in a residential weight control treatment including low-calorie diet (1200 cal/day) and physical training, were randomly assigned either to the multidimensional VR treatment or to psychonutritional groups based on the cognitive-behavior approach. Patients were administered a battery of outcome measures assessing eating disorders symptomathology, attitudes toward food, body dissatisfaction, level of anxiety, motivation for change, level of assertiveness, and general psychiatric symptoms. In the short term, the VR treatment was more effective than the traditional cognitive-behavioral psychonutritional groups in improving the overall psychological state of the patients. In particular, the therapy was more effective in improving body satisfaction, self-efficacy, and motivation for change. No significant differences were found in the reduction of the binge eating behavior. The possibility of inducing a significant change in body image and its associated behaviors using a VR-based short-term therapy can be useful to improve the body satisfaction in traditional weight reduction programs.

While there are many common threads, there are also individual differences. Common reasons for choosing computing as a career included: exposure to computing in a setting which enabled them to see the versatility of computers; the influence of someone close to them; personal abilities which they perceived to be appropriate for a career in computing; and characteristics of such careers which appealed to them.

The feasible set of H is {k: H has a strict k-coloring}. Among other results, we prove that a finite set of positive integers is the feasible set of some mixed hypergraph if and only if it omits the number I or is an interval starting with 1.

Decades of research into the structure and function of the cerebellum have led to a clear understanding of many of its cells, as well as how learning might take place. Furthermore, there are many theories on what signals the cerebellum operates on, and how it works in concert with other parts of the nervous system. Nevertheless, the application of computational cerebellar models to the control of robot dynamics remains in its infant state. To date, few applications have been realized. The currently emerging family of light-weight robots poses a new challenge to robot control: due to their complex dynamics traditional methods, depending on a full analysis of the dynamics of the system, are no longer applicable since the joints influence each other dynamics during movement. Can artificial cerebellar models compete here?", "921": "Processing of complexly shaped multiply connected domains in finite element mesh generation. Large number of finite element models in modern materials science and engineering is defined on complexly shaped domains, quite often multiply connected. Generation of quality finite element meshes on such domains, especially in cases when the mesh must be 100% quadrilateral, is highly problematic. This paper describes mathematical fundamentals and practical -implementation of a powerful method and algorithm allowing transformation of multiply connected domains of arbitrary geometrical complexity into a set of simple domains; the latter can then be processed by broadly available finite element mesh generators. The developed method was applied to a number of complex geometries, including those arising in analysis of parasitic inductances and capacitances in printed circuit boards. The quality of practical results produced by the method and its programming implementation provide evidence that the algorithm can be applied to other finite element models with various physical backgrounds", "1381": "An augmented spatial digital tree algorithm for contact detection in computational mechanics. Based on the understanding of existing spatial digital tree-based contact detection approaches, and the alternating digital tree (ADT) algorithm in particular, a more efficient algorithm, termed the augmented spatial digital tree (ASDT) algorithm, is proposed in the present work. The ASDT algorithm adopts a different point representation scheme that uses only the lower comer vertex to represent a (hyper-)rectangle, with the upper comer vertex serving as the augmented information. Consequently, the ASDT algorithm can keep the working space the same as the original n-dimensional space and, in general, a much better balanced tree can be expected. This, together with the introduction of an additional bounding subregion for the rectangles associated with each tree node, makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of node visits in the region search, although each node visit may be slightly more expensive. Three examples arising in computational mechanics are presented to provide an assessment of the performance of the ASDT. The numerical results indicate that the ASDT is, at least, over 3.9 times faster than the ADT", "586": "A strategy for a payoff-switching differential game based on fuzzy reasoning. In this paper, a new concept of a payoff-switching differential game is introduced. In this new game, any one player at any time may have several choices of payoffs for the future. Moreover, the payoff-switching process, including the time of payoff switching and the outcome payoff, of any one player is unknown to the other. Indeed, the overall payoff, which is a sequence of several payoffs, is unknown until the game ends. An algorithm for determining a reasoning strategy based on fuzzy reasoning is proposed. In this algorithm, the fuzzy theory is used to estimate the behavior of one player during a past time interval. By deriving two fuzzy matrices GSM, game similarity matrix, and VGSM, variation of GSM, the behavior of the player can be quantified. Two weighting vectors are selected to weight the relative importance of the player's behavior at each past time instant. Finally a simple fuzzy inference rule is adopted to generate a linear reasoning strategy. The advantage of this algorithm is that it provides a flexible way for differential game specialists to convert their knowledge into a \"reasonable\" strategy. A practical example of guarding three territories is given to illustrate our main ideas", "693": "Lifting factorization of discrete W transform. A general method is proposed to factor the type-IV discrete W transform (DWT-IV) into lifting steps and additions. Then, based on the relationships among various types of DWTs, four types of DWTs are factored into lifting steps and additions. After approximating the lifting matrices, we get four types of new integer DWTs (IntDWT-I, IntDWT-II, IntDWT-III, and IntDWT-IV) which are floating-point multiplication free. Integer-to-integer transforms (II-DWT), which approximate to DWT, are also proposed.

We are developing HPF/SX V2, a High Performance Fortran (HPF) compiler for vector parallel machines. It provides some unique extensions as well as the features of HPF 2.0 and HPF/JA.

We evaluate these features through some benchmark programs on NEC SX-5. The results show that each of them achieved a 5-8 times speedup in 8-CPU parallel execution and the four features are useful for vector parallel execution. We also evaluate the overall performance of HPF/SX V2 by using over 30 well-known benchmark programs from HPFBench, APR Benchmarks, GENESIS Benchmarks, and NAS Parallel Benchmarks. About half of the programs showed good performance, while the other half suggest weakness of the compiler, especially on its runtimes.

The lack of compatibility of High-Performance Fortran (HPF) between vender implementations has been disheartening scientific application users so as to hinder the development of portable programs. Thus parallel computing is still unpopular in the computational science community, even though parallel programming is common to the computer science community. As users would like to run the same source code on parallel machines with different architectures as fast as possible, we have investigated the compatibility of source codes for Japanese HPF compilers (NEC, Fujitsu and Hitachi) with two real-world applications: a 3D fluid code and a 2D particle code. We have found that the source-level compatibility between Japanese HPF compilers is almost preserved, but more effort will be needed to sustain complete compatibility. We have also evaluated parallel performance and found that HPF can achieve good performance for the 3D fluid code with almost the same source code. For the 2D particle code, good results have also been obtained with a small number of processors, but some changes in the original source code and the addition of interface blocks is required", "1382": "Loop restructuring for data I/O minimization on limited on-chip memory embedded processors. In this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing the flow of values and their reuse in loop nests to minimize data traffic under the constraints of limited on-chip memory capacity and dependences. Our analysis first undertakes fusion of possible loop nests intra-procedurally and then performs loop distribution. The analysis discovers the closeness factor of two statements which is a quantitative measure of data traffic saved per unit memory occupied if the statements were under the same loop nest over the case where they are under different loop nests. We then develop a greedy algorithm which traverses the program dependence graph to group statements together under the same loop nest legally to promote maximal reuse per unit of memory occupied. We implemented our framework in Petit, a tool for dependence analysis and loop transformations. We compared our method with one based on tiling of fused loop nest and one based on a greedy strategy to purely maximize reuse. We show that our methods work better than both of these strategies in most cases for processors such as TMS320Cxx, which have a very limited amount of on-chip memory. The improvements in data I/O range from 10 to 30 percent over tiling and from 10 to 40 percent over maximal reuse for JPEG loops", "83": "A distributed mobile agent framework for maintaining persistent distance education. Mobile agent techniques involve distributed control if communication is required among different types of agents, especially when mobile agents can migrate from station to station.

In this research paper, we propose a distributed agent framework along with its communication messages to facilitate mobile personal agents, which serve three different groups of distance education users: instructors, students, and system administrators. We propose an agent communication framework as well as agent evolution states of mobile agents. The communication architecture and message transmission protocols are illustrated. The system is implemented on the Windows platform to support nomadic accessibility of remote distance learning users.

In this paper we present experimental investigations of the vibration testing of an inflated, thin-film torus using smart materials. Lightweight, inflatable structures are very attractive in satellite applications. However, the lightweight, flexible and highly damped nature of inflated structures poses difficulties in ground vibration testing. In this study, we show that polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) patches and recently developed macro-fiber composite actuators may be used as sensors and actuators in identifying modal parameters. Both smart materials can be integrated unobtrusively into the skin of a torus or space device forming an attractive testing arrangement. The addition of actuators and PVDF sensors to the torus does not significantly interfere with the suspension modes of a free-free boundary condition, and can be considered an integral part of the inflated structure. The results indicate the potential of using smart materials to measure and control the dynamic response of inflated structures", "929": "Closed loop finite-element modeling of active constrained layer damping in the time domain analysis. A three-dimensional finite-element closed-loop model has been developed to predict the effects of active-passive damping on a vibrating structure. The Golla-Hughes-McTavish method is employed to capture the viscoelastic material behavior in a time domain analysis. The parametric study includes the different control gains as well as geometric parameters related to the active constrained layer damping (ACLD) treatment. Comparisons are made among several ACLD models, the passive constrained model and the active damping model. The results obtained here reiterate that ACLD is somewhat better for vibration suppression than either the purely passive or the active system and provides higher structural damping with less control gain when compared to the purely active system. Since the ACLD performance can be reduced by the viscoelastic layer, the design of the ACLD model must be given a careful consideration in order to optimize the effect of passive damping", "927": "Autonomous detection of crack initiation using surface-mounted piezotransducers. In this paper we report on the application of an in situ health monitoring system, comprising an array of piezoceramic wafer elements, to the detection of fatigue degradation in metallic specimens exposed to cyclic loading.

Previously Z. Ras and J.M. Zytkow (2000) introduced and investigated query answering system based on distributed knowledge mining. The notion of an action rule was introduced by Z. Ras and A. Wieczorkowska (2000) and its application domain e-business was taken. In this paper, we generalize the notion of action rules in a similar way to handling global queries. Mainly, when values of attributes for a given customer, used in action rules, can not be easily changed by business user, definitions of these attributes are extracted from other sites of a distributed knowledge system. To be more precise, attributes at every site of a distributed knowledge system are divided into two sets: stable and flexible. Values of flexible attributes, for a given consumer, sometime can be changed and this change can be influenced and controlled by a business user. However, some of these changes (for instance to the attribute \"profit') can not be done directly to a chosen attribute. In this case, definitions of such an attribute in terms of other attributes have to be learned. These new definitions are used to construct action rules showing what changes in values of flexible attributes, for a given consumer, are needed in order to re-classify this consumer the way business user wants. But, business user may be either unable or unwilling to proceed with actions leading to such changes. In all such cases we may search for definitions of these flexible attributes looking at either local or remote sites for help", "717": "A network simplex algorithm with O(n) consecutive degenerate pivots. We suggest a pivot rule for the primal simplex algorithm for the minimum cost flow problem, known as the network simplex algorithm. Due to degeneracy, cycling may occur in the network simplex algorithm. The cycling can be prevented by maintaining strongly feasible bases proposed by Cunningham (1976); however, if we do not impose any restrictions on the entering variables, the algorithm can still perform an exponentially long sequence of degenerate pivots. This phenomenon is known as stalling. Researchers have suggested several pivot rules with the following bounds on the number of consecutive degenerate pivots: m, n/sup 2/, k(k + 1)/2, where n is the number of nodes in the network, m is the number of arcs in the network, and k is the number of degenerate arcs in the basis. (Observe that k <or= n.) In this paper, we describe an anti-stalling pivot rule that ensures that the network simplex algorithm performs at most k consecutive degenerate pivots. This rule uses a negative cost augmenting cycle to identify a sequence of entering variables", "1132": "Semidefinite programming vs. LP relaxations for polynomial programming.

A fast MR pulse sequence with spiral in-plane readout and conventional 3D partition encoding was developed for multiphase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) of the renal vasculature. Compared to a standard multiphase 3D CE-MRA with FLASH readout, an isotropic in-plane spatial resolution of 1.4*1.4 mm/sup 2/ over 2.0*1.4 mm/sup 2/ could be achieved with a temporal resolution of 6 sec. The theoretical gain of spatial resolution by using the spiral pulse sequence and the performance in the presence of turbulent flow was evaluated in phantom measurements. Multiphase 3D CE-MRA of the renal arteries was performed in five healthy volunteers using both techniques. A deblurring technique was used to correct the spiral raw data. Thereby, the off-resonance frequencies were determined by minimizing the imaginary part of the data in image space. The chosen correction algorithm was able to reduce image blurring substantially in all MRA phases. The image quality of the spiral CE-MRA pulse sequence was comparable to that of the FLASH CE-MRA with increased spatial resolution and a 25% reduced contrast-to-noise ratio. Additionally, artifacts specific to spiral MRI could be observed which had no impact on the assessment of the renal arteries", "1140": "Computer aided classification of masses in ultrasonic mammography. Frequency compounding was recently investigated for computer aided classification of masses in ultrasonic B-mode images as benign or malignant. The classification was performed using the normalized parameters of the Nakagami distribution at a single region of interest at the site of the mass. A combination of normalized Nakagami parameters from two different images of a mass was undertaken to improve the performance of classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that such an approach resulted in an area of 0.83 under the ROC curve. The aim of the work described in this paper is to see whether a feature describing the characteristic of the boundary can be extracted and combined with the Nakagami parameter to further improve the performance of classification. The combination of the features has been performed using a weighted summation. Results indicate a 10% improvement in specificity at a sensitivity of 96% after combining the information at the site and at the boundary.

Fuzzy set methodologies have proved well suited for encoding the forecaster's knowledge, and for accommodating the uncertainty inherent in the specification of rules, as well as in subjective and objective input. MEDEX uses fuzzy set theory in two ways: as a fuzzy rule base in the expert system, and for fuzzy pattern matching to select dominant wind circulation patterns as one input to the expert system. The system was developed, tuned, and verified over a two-year period, during which the weather conditions from 539 days were individually analyzed.

Between 1997 and 2001, two mid-sized communities in Canada hosted North America's most comprehensive experiment to introduce electronic cash and, in the process, replace physical cash for casual, low-value payments. The technology used was Mondex, and its implementation was supported by all the country's major banks. It was launched with an extensive publicity campaign to promote Mondex not only in the domestic but also in the global market, for which the Canadian implementation was to serve as a \"showcase.\" However, soon after the start of the first field test it became apparent that the new technology did not work smoothly. On the contrary, it created a host of controversies, in areas as varied as computer security, consumer privacy, and monetary policy. In the following years, few of these controversies could be resolved and Mondex could not be established as a widely used payment mechanism. In 2001, the experiment was finally terminated. Using the concepts developed in recent science and technology studies (STS), the article analyzes these controversies as resulting from the difficulties of fitting electronic cash, a new sociotechnical system, into the complex setting of the existing payment system. The story of Mondex not only offers lessons on why technologies fail, but also offers insight into how short-term failures can contribute to long-term transformations. This suggests the need to rethink the dichotomy of success and failure", "1179": "Evolution complexity of the elementary cellular automaton rule 18. Cellular automata are classes of mathematical systems characterized by discreteness (in space, time, and state values), determinism, and local interaction.

The pipeline shrinkage problem for women in computer science is a well-known and documented phenomenon where the ratio of women to men involved in computing shrinks dramatically from early student years to working years. During the last decade, considerable research ensued to understand the reasons behind the existence of the shrinking pipeline and in some cases to take action to increase the numbers of women in computing. Through the work of a National Science Foundation funded project, ACM's Committee on Women in Computing (ACM-W) has taken a first step towards pulling this research together. A large number of articles was gathered and processed on the topic of women in computing and the shrinking pipeline. The committee created a publicly available online database to organize the references of this body of work by topic, author, and reference information. The database, constantly being updated, is accessible through ACM-W's website <http://www.acm.org/women>. A final report is also available via the ACM-W Web site which covers current statistics on women in computing, summaries of the literature in the database, and a set of recommendations.

We present a technique for the automatic adaptation of a deformable model's elastic parameters within a Kalman filter framework for shape estimation applications. The novelty of the technique is that the model's elastic parameters are not constant, but spatio-temporally varying. The variation of the elastic parameters depends on the distance of the model from the data and the rate of change of this distance. Each pass of the algorithm uses physics-based modeling techniques to iteratively adjust both the geometric and the elastic degrees of freedom of the model in response to forces that are computed from the discrepancy between the model and the data. By augmenting the state equations of an extended Kalman filter to incorporate these additional variables, we are able to significantly improve the quality of the shape estimation. Therefore, the model's elastic parameters are always initialized to the same value and they are subsequently modified depending on the data and the noise distribution. We present results demonstrating the effectiveness of our method for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional data", "953": "Take it to the next level [law firm innovation]. It's called innovating.

An effective technique for flaw detection of composites is proposed. In this technique, the detection problem is formulated as an optimization problem minimizing the difference between the measured and calculated surface displacement response derived from scattered elastic-wave fields. A combined optimization technique using an improved mu GA and a local optimizer is developed to solve the optimization problem so as to obtain the flaw parameters defining flaw configurations. Guidelines for implementing the detection technique, including formulation of the objective function of the optimization problem using different error norms, improvement of mu GA convergence performance, switching from mu GA to local optimizer in the optimization process, and suppression of the effect of noise on detection results, are addressed in detail.

Based on users' experiences of Version 1.3 of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) of the Object Management Group (OMG), a Request For Information in 1999 elicited several responses which were asked to identify \"problems\" but not to offer any solutions. One of these responses is examined for \"problems\" relating to the UML metamodel and here some solutions to the problems identified there are proposed. Specifically, we evaluate the metamodel relating to stereotypes versus subtypes; the various kinds of Classifier (particularly Types, Interfaces and Classes); the introduction of a new subtype for the whole part relationship; as well as identifying areas in the metamodel where the UML seems to have been used inappropriately in the very definition of the UML's metamodel", "102": "Harmless delays in Cohen-Grossberg neural networks.

Lyapunov functionals and functions combined with the Razumikhin technique are employed. The criteria are all independent of the magnitudes of the delays, and thus the delays under these conditions are harmless", "827": "Williams nears end of Chapter 11 [telecom].

Describes how to estimate 3D surface models from dense sets of noisy range data taken from different points of view, i.e., multiple range maps. The proposed method uses a sensor model to develop an expression for the likelihood of a 3D surface, conditional on a set of noisy range measurements. Optimizing this likelihood with respect to the model parameters provides an unbiased and efficient estimator. The proposed numerical algorithms make this estimation computationally practical for a wide variety of circumstances. The results from this method compare favorably with state-of-the-art approaches that rely on the closest-point or perpendicular distance metric, a convenient heuristic that produces biased solutions and fails completely when surfaces are not sufficiently smooth, as in the case of complex scenes or noisy range measurements. Empirical results on both simulated and real ladar data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for several different types of problems. Furthermore, the proposed method offers a general framework that can accommodate extensions to include surface priors, more sophisticated noise models, and other sensing modalities, such as sonar or synthetic aperture radar", "1175": "Prediction of tool and chip temperature in continuous and interrupted machining. A numerical model based on the finite difference method is presented to predict tool and chip temperature fields in continuous machining and time varying milling processes. Continuous or steady state machining operations like orthogonal cutting are studied by modeling the heat transfer between the tool and chip at the tool-rake face contact zone. The shear energy created in the primary zone, the friction energy produced at the rake face-chip contact zone and the heat balance between the moving chip and stationary tool are considered. The temperature distribution is solved using the finite difference method. Later, the model is extended to milling where the cutting is interrupted and the chip thickness varies with time. The proposed model combines the steady-state temperature prediction in continuous machining with transient temperature evaluation in interrupted cutting operations where the chip and the process change in a discontinuous manner. The mathematical models and simulation results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental temperature measurements reported in the literature", "1094": "Efficient allocation of knowledge in distributed business structures.

For a two-level system in which the decoherence channel is non-dissipative, we show that decoherence suppression is possible if memory is present in the channel. Random switching between two potentially harmful noise sources can then provide a source of stochastic control.

We outline a hybrid analog-digital scheme for computing with three important features that enable it to scale to systems of large complexity: First, like digital computation, which uses several one-bit precise logical units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation, the hybrid scheme uses several moderate-precision analog units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation. Second, frequent discrete signal restoration of the analog information prevents analog noise and offset from degrading the computation. Third, a state machine enables complex computations to be created using a sequence of elementary computations. A natural choice for implementing this hybrid scheme is one based on spikes because spike-count codes are digital, while spike-time codes are analog. We illustrate how spikes afford easy ways to implement all three components of scalable hybrid computation. First, as an important example of distributed analog computation, we show how spikes can create a distributed modular representation of an analog number by implementing digital carry interactions between spiking analog neurons. Second, we show how signal restoration may be performed by recursive spike-count quantization of spike-time codes. Third, we use spikes from an analog dynamical system to trigger state transitions in a digital dynamical system, which reconfigures the analog dynamical system using a binary control vector; such feedback interactions between analog and digital dynamical systems create a hybrid state machine (HSM). The HSM extends and expands the concept of a digital finite-state-machine to the hybrid domain. We present experimental data from a two-neuron HSM on a chip that implements error-correcting analog-to-digital conversion with the concurrent use of spike-time and spike-count codes. We also present experimental data from silicon circuits that implement HSM-based pattern recognition using spike-time synchrony. We outline how HSMs may be used to perform learning, vector quantization, spike pattern recognition and generation, and how they may be reconfigured", "1133": "An analytic center cutting plane method for semidefinite feasibility problems. Semidefinite feasibility problems arise in many areas of operations research. The abstract form of these problems can be described as finding a point in a nonempty bounded convex body Gamma in the cone of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. Assume that Gamma is defined by an oracle, which for any given m * m symmetric positive semidefinite matrix Gamma either confirms that Y epsilon Gamma or returns a cut, i.e., a symmetric matrix A such that Gamma is in the half-space {Y : A . Y <or= A . Y}. We study an analytic center cutting plane algorithm for this problem. At each iteration, the algorithm computes an approximate analytic center of a working set defined by the cutting plane system generated in the previous iterations. If this approximate analytic center is a solution, then the algorithm terminates; otherwise the new cutting plane returned by the oracle is added into the system. As the number of iterations increases, the working set shrinks and the algorithm eventually finds a solution to the problem. All iterates generated by the algorithm are positive definite matrices. The algorithm has a worst-case complexity of O*(m/sup 3// epsilon /sup 2/) on the total number of cuts to be used, where epsilon is the maximum radius of a ball contained by Gamma", "819": "Local search with constraint propagation and conflict-based heuristics. Search algorithms for solving CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) usually fall into one of two main families: local search algorithms and systematic algorithms. Both families have their advantages. Designing hybrid approaches seems promising since those advantages may be combined into a single approach. In this paper, we present a new hybrid technique. It performs a local search over partial assignments instead of complete assignments, and uses filtering techniques and conflict-based techniques to efficiently guide the search. This new technique benefits from both classical approaches: a priori pruning of the search space from filtering-based search and possible repair of early mistakes from local search. We focus on a specific version of this technique: tabu decision-repair.

We discuss the critical point x/sub c/ separating the quantum entangled and separable states in two series of N spins S in the simple mixed state characterized by the matrix operator rho = x| phi >< phi |+1-x/D/sup N/I/sub D/N, where x in [0, 1], D = 2S + 1, I/sub D/N is the D/sup N/ * D/sup N/ unity matrix and | phi > is a special entangled state. The cases x = 0 and x = 1 correspond respectively to fully random spins and to a fully entangled state. In the first of these series we consider special states | phi > invariant under charge conjugation, that generalizes the N = 2 spin S = 1/2 Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state, and in the second one we consider generalizations of the Werner (1989) density matrices. The evaluation of the critical point x/sub c/ was done through bounds coming from the partial transposition method of Peres (1996) and the conditional nonextensive entropy criterion. Our results suggest the conjecture that whenever the bounds coming from both methods coincide the result of x/sub c/ is the exact one.

Interconnected ultrathin conducting wires or, equivalently, interconnected quasi-one-dimensional electron waveguides, which form a quantum resistor network, are presented here in four-terminal configurations. The transmission behaviors through such four-terminal networks are evaluated and classified. In addition, we show that such networks can be used as the basic building blocks for a possible massive wave computing machine in the future. In a network, each interconnection, a node point, is an elastic scatterer that routes the electron wave. Routing and rerouting of electron waves in a network is described in the framework of quantum transport from Landauer-Buttiker theory in the presence of multiple elastic scatterers. Transmissions through various types of four-terminal generalized clean Aharonov-Bohm rings are investigated at zero temperature. Useful logic functions are gathered based on the transmission probability to each terminal with the use of the Buttiker symmetry rule. In the generalized rings, even and odd numbers of terminals can possess some distinctly different transmission characteristics as we have shown here and earlier. Just as an even or odd number of atoms in a ring is an important quantity for classifying the transmission behavior, we show here that whether the number of terminals is an even or an odd number is just as important in understanding the physics of transmission through such a ring. Furthermore, we show that there are three basic classes of four-terminal rings and the scaling relation for each class is provided. In particular, the existence of equitransmission among all four terminals is shown here. This particular physical phenomena cannot exist in any three-terminal ring. Comparisons and discussions of transmission characteristics between three-terminal and four-terminal rings are also presented. The node-equation approach by considering the Kirchhoff current conservation law at each node point is used for this analysis. Many useful logic functions for electron-wave computing are shown here. In particular, we show that a full adder can be constructed very simply using the equitransmission property of the four-terminal ring. This is in sharp contrast with circuits based on transistor logic", "132": "A unified view for vector rotational CORDIC algorithms and architectures based on angle quantization approach. Vector rotation is the key operation employed extensively in many digital signal processing applications. In this paper, we introduce a new design concept called Angle Quantization (AQ). It can be used as a design index for vector rotational operation, where the rotational angle is known in advance. Based on the AQ process, we establish a unified design framework for cost-effective low-latency rotational algorithms and architectures. Several existing works, such as conventional COordinate Rotational Digital Computer (CORDIC), AR-CORDIC, MVR-CORDIC, and EEAS-based CORDIC, can be fitted into the design framework, forming a Vector Rotational CORDIC Family. Moreover, we address four searching algorithms to solve the optimization problem encountered in the proposed vector rotational CORDIC family. The corresponding scaling operations of the CORDIC family are also discussed. Based on the new design framework, we can realize high-speed/low-complexity rotational VLSI circuits, whereas without degrading the precision performance in fixed-point implementations", "75": "A portable Auto Attendant System with sophisticated dialog structure. An attendant system connects the caller to the party he/she wants to talk to. Traditional systems require the caller to know the full name of the party. If the caller forgets the name, the system fails to provide service for the caller. In this paper we propose a portable Auto Attendant System (AAS) with sophisticated dialog structure that gives a caller more flexibility while calling. The caller may interact with the system to request a phone number by providing just a work area, specialty, surname, or title, etc. If the party is absent, the system may provide extra information such as where he went, when he will be back, and what he is doing. The system is built modularly, with components such as speech recognizer, language model, dialog manager and text-to-speech that can be replaced if necessary. By simply changing the personnel record database, the system can easily be ported to other companies. The sophisticated dialog manager applies many strategies to allow natural interaction between user and system. Functions such as fuzzy request, user repairing, and extra information query, which are not provided by other systems, are integrated into our system. Experimental results and comparisons to other systems show that our approach provides a more user friendly and natural interaction for auto attendant system", "1114": "A new algebraic modelling approach to distributed problem-solving in MAS.

The model has an exactly solvable statistic: the critical exponents and scaling functions of the SAT/UNSAT transition are calculable at zero temperature, with no need of replicas, also with exact finite-size corrections. We also introduce an exact duality of the model, and show an analogy of thermodynamic properties with the random energy model of disordered spin system theory. Relations with error correcting codes are also discussed", "1231": "Efficient parallel programming on scalable shared memory systems with High Performance Fortran. OpenMP offers a high-level interface for parallel programming on scalable shared memory (SMP) architectures. It provides the user with simple work-sharing directives while it relies on the compiler to generate parallel programs based on thread parallelism. However, the lack of language features for exploiting data locality often results in poor performance since the non-uniform memory access times on scalable SMP machines cannot be neglected. High Performance Fortran (HPF), the de-facto standard for data parallel programming, offers a rich set of data distribution directives in order to exploit data locality, but it has been mainly targeted towards distributed memory machines. In this paper we describe an optimized execution model for HPF programs on SMP machines that avails itself with mechanisms provided by OpenMP for work sharing and thread parallelism, while exploiting data locality based on user-specified distribution directives. Data locality does not only ensure that most memory accesses are close to the executing threads and are therefore faster, but it also minimizes synchronization overheads, especially in the case of unstructured reductions. The proposed shared memory execution model for HPF relies on a small set of language extensions, which resemble the OpenMP work-sharing features. These extensions, together with an optimized shared memory parallelization and execution model, have been implemented in the ADAPTOR HPF compilation system and experimental results verify the efficiency of the chosen approach", "70": "IT security issues: the need for end user oriented research.

Multicast offers an efficient means of distributing video contents/programs to multiple clients by batching their requests and then having them share a server's video stream. Batching customers' requests is either client-initiated or server-initiated. Most advanced client-initiated video multicasts are implemented by patching. Periodic broadcast, a typical server-initiated approach, can be entirety-based or segment-based. This paper focuses on the performance of the VoD service for popular videos. First, we analyze the limitation of conventional patching when the customer request rate is high. Then, by combining the advantages of each of the two broadcast schemes, we propose a hybrid broadcast scheme for popular videos, which not only lowers the service latency but also improves clients' interactivity by using an active buffering technique. This is shown to be a good compromise for both lowering service latency and improving the VCR-like interactivity", "601": "Recent researches of human science on railway systems.

We analyse the requirements for an optimal schedule and then provide a mathematical framework for an efficient schedule of material delivery by an AGV. A mathematical model is developed and then a strategy for optimal material distribution of the available raw material to the MCs is derived. With this model, the optimal number of MCs to be utilized is also determined. Finally, the material delivery schedule employing multiple journeys to the MCs by the AGV is carried out. Through rigorous analysis and simulation experiments, we show that such a delivery strategy will optimize the overall performance", "1222": "Mining the optimal class association rule set. We define an optimal class association rule set to be the minimum rule set with the same predictive power of the complete class association rule set. Using this rule set instead of the complete class association rule set we can avoid redundant computation that would otherwise be required for mining predictive association rules and hence improve the efficiency of the mining process significantly. We present an efficient algorithm for mining the optimal class association rule set using an upward closure property of pruning weak rules before they are actually generated. We have implemented the algorithm and our experimental results show that our algorithm generates the optimal class association rule set, whose size is smaller than 1/17 of the complete class association rule set on average, in significantly less time than generating the complete class association rule set.

We introduce new families of Gaussian-type quadratures for weighted integrals of exponential functions and consider their applications to integration and interpolation of bandlimited functions. We use a generalization of a representation theorem due to Caratheodory to derive these quadratures. For each positive measure, the quadratures are parameterized by eigenvalues of the Toeplitz matrix constructed from the trigonometric moments of the measure. For a given accuracy epsilon , selecting an eigenvalue close to epsilon yields an approximate quadrature with that accuracy. To compute its weights and nodes, we present a new fast algorithm.

This paper presents methods for speaker adaptive modeling using vocal tract normalization (VTN) along with experimental tests on three databases. We propose a new training method for VTN: By using single-density acoustic models per HMM state for selecting the scale factor of the frequency axis, we avoid the problem that a mixture-density tends to learn the scale factors of the training speakers and thus cannot be used for selecting the scale factor. We show that using single Gaussian densities for selecting the scale factor in training results in lower error rates than using mixture densities. For the recognition phase, we propose an improvement of the well-known two-pass strategy: by using a non-normalized acoustic model for the first recognition pass instead of a normalized model, lower error rates are obtained. In recognition tests, this method is compared with a fast variant of VTN. The two-pass strategy is an efficient method, but it is suboptimal because the scale factor and the word sequence are determined sequentially. We found that for telephone digit string recognition this suboptimality reduces the VTN gain in recognition performance by 30% relative. In summary, on the German spontaneous speech task Verbmobil, the WSJ task and the German telephone digit string corpus SieTill, the proposed methods for VTN reduce the error rates significantly", "1365": "Deadlock-free scheduling in flexible manufacturing systems using Petri nets. This paper addresses the deadlock-free scheduling problem in Flexible Manufacturing Systems. An efficient deadlock-free scheduling algorithm was developed, using timed Petri nets, for a class of FMSs called Systems of Sequential Systems with Shared Resources (S/sup 4/ R). The algorithm generates a partial reachability graph to find the optimal or near-optimal deadlock-free schedule in terms of the firing sequence of the transitions of the Petri net model. The objective is to minimize the mean flow time (MFT). An efficient truncation technique, based on the siphon concept, has been developed and used to generate the minimum necessary portion of the reachability graph to be searched. It has been shown experimentally that the developed siphon truncation technique enhances the ability to develop deadlock-free schedules of systems with a high number of deadlocks, which cannot be achieved using standard Petri net scheduling approaches. It may be necessary, in some cases, to relax the optimality condition for large FMSs in order to make the search effort reasonable. Hence, a User Control Factor (UCF) was defined and used in the scheduling algorithm. The objective of using the UCF is to achieve an acceptable trade-off between the solution quality and the search effort. Its effect on the MFT and the CPU time has been investigated. Randomly generated examples are used for illustration and comparison. Although the effect of UCF did not affect the mean flow time, it was shown that increasing it reduces the search effort (CPU time) significantly", "688": "Active vibration control of piezolaminated smart beams. This paper deals with the active vibration control of beam like structures with distributed piezoelectric sensor and actuator layers bonded on top and bottom surfaces of the beam. A finite element model based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory has been developed. The contribution of the piezoelectric sensor and actuator layers on the mass and stiffness of the beam is considered. Three types of classical control strategies, namely direct proportional feedback, constant-gain negative velocity feedback and Lyapunov feedback and an optimal control strategy, linear quadratic regulator (LQR) scheme are applied to study their control effectiveness. Also, the control performance with different types of loading, such as impulse loading, step loading, harmonic and random loading is studied", "74": "End-user perspectives on the uptake of computer supported cooperative working. Researchers in information systems have produced a rich collection of meta-analyses and models to further understanding of factors influencing the uptake of information technologies. In the domain of CSCW, however, these models have largely been neglected, and while there are many case studies, no systematic account of uptake has been produced. We use findings from information systems research to structure a meta-analysis of uptake issues as reported in CSCW case studies, supplemented by a detailed re-examination of one of our own case studies from this perspective. This shows that while there are some factors which seem to be largely specific to CSCW introductions, many of the case study results are very similar to standard IS findings. We conclude by suggesting how the two communities of researchers might build on each other's work, and finally propose activity theory as a means of integrating the two perspectives", "540": "Ventilation-perfusion ratio of signal intensity in human lung using oxygen-enhanced and arterial spin labeling techniques. This study investigates the distribution of ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) signal intensity (SI) ratios using oxygen-enhanced and arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques in the lungs of 10 healthy volunteers. Ventilation and perfusion images were simultaneously acquired using the flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) method as volunteers alternately inhaled room air and 100% oxygen. Images of the T/sub 1/ distribution were calculated for five volunteers for both selective (T/sub 1f/) and nonselective (T/sub 1/) inversion. The average T/sub 1/ was 1360 ms+or-116 ms, and the average T/sub 1f/ was 1012 ms+or-112 ms, yielding a difference that is statistically significant (P<0.002). Excluding large pulmonary vessels, the average V/Q SI ratios were 0.355+or-0.073 for the left lung and 0.371+or-0.093 for the right lung, which are in agreement with the theoretical V/Q SI ratio. Plots of the WO SI ratio are similar to the logarithmic normal distribution obtained by multiple inert gas elimination techniques, with a range of ratios matching ventilation and perfusion. This MRI V/Q technique is completely noninvasive and does not involve ionized radiation. A limitation of this method is the nonsimultaneous acquisition of perfusion and ventilation data, with oxygen administered only for the ventilation data", "963": "A computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a one-way avoidance experiment. We present a computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a one-way avoidance experiment. Our model employs the reinforcement learning paradigm and a temporal-difference algorithm to implement both classically conditioned and instrumentally conditioned components. The role of the classically conditioned component is to develop an expectation of future benefit that is a function of the learning system's state and action. Competition among the instrumentally conditioned components determines the overt behavior generated by the learning system. Our model displays, in simulation, the reduced latency of the avoidance behavior during learning with continuing trials and the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response. These results are consistent with experimentally observed animal behavior. Our model extends the traditional two-process learning mechanism of Mowrer (1947) by explicitly defining the mechanisms of proprioceptive feedback, an internal clock, and generalization over the action space", "981": "Basin configuration of a six-dimensional model of an electric power system. As part of an ongoing project on the stability of massively complex electrical power systems, we discuss the global geometric structure of contacts among the basins of attraction of a six-dimensional dynamical system. This system represents a simple model of an electrical power system involving three machines and an infinite bus. Apart from the possible occurrence of attractors representing pathological states, the contacts between the basins have a practical importance, from the point of view of the operation of a real electrical power system. With the aid of a global map of basins, one could hope to design an intervention strategy to boot the power system back into its normal state. Our method involves taking two-dimensional sections of the six-dimensional state space, and then determining the basins directly by numerical simulation from a dense grid of initial conditions. The relations among all the basins are given for a specific numerical example, that is, choosing particular values for the parameters in our model", "1096": "Evaluating alternative manufacturing control strategies using a benchmark system. This paper describes an investigation of the effects of dynamic job routing and job sequencing decisions on the performance of a distributed control system and its adaptability against disturbances. This experimental work was carried out to compare the performance of alternative control strategies in various manufacturing environments and to investigate the relationship between the 'control' and 'controlled' systems. The experimental test-bed presented in this paper consists of an agent-based control system (implemented in C++) and a discrete-event simulation model. Using this test-bed, various control strategies were tested on a benchmark manufacturing system by varying production volumes (to model the production system with looser/tighter schedules) and disturbance frequencies. It was found that hybrid strategies that combine reactive agent mechanisms (and allocation strategies such as the contract net) with appropriate job sequencing heuristics provide the best performance, particularly when job congestion increases on a shop-floor", "720": "19in monitors [CRT survey].

The great potential offered by virtual reality (VR) to clinical psychologists derives prevalently from the central role, in psychotherapy, occupied by the imagination and by memory. These two elements, which are fundamental in our life, present absolute and relative limits to the individual potential. Using VR as an advanced imaginal system, an experience that is able to reduce the gap existing between imagination and reality, it is possible to transcend these limits. In this sense, VR can improve the efficacy of a psychological therapy for its capability of reducing the distinction between the computer's reality and the conventional reality. Two are the core characteristics of this synthetic imaginal experience: the perceptual illusion of nonmediation and the possibility of building and sharing a common ground. In this sense, experiencing presence in a clinical virtual environment (VE), such as a shared virtual hospital, requires more than reproduction of the physical features of external reality. It requires the creation and sharing of the cultural web that makes meaningful, and therefore visible, both people and objects populating the environment.

The RF field intensity distribution in the human brain becomes inhomogeneous due to wave behavior at high field. This is further complicated by the spatial distribution of RF field polarization that must be considered to predict image intensity distribution. An additional layer of complexity is involved when a quadrature coil is used for transmission and reception. To study such complicated RF field behavior, a computer modeling method was employed to investigate the RF field of a quadrature surface coil at 300 MHz. Theoretical and experimental results for a phantom and the human head at 7.0 T are presented. The results are theoretically important and practically useful for high-field quadrature coil design and application", "942": "Micro-optical realization of arrays of selectively addressable dipole traps: a scalable configuration for quantum computation with atomic qubits.

We are able to selectively address individual trap sites due to their large lateral separation of 125 mu m. We initialize and read out different internal states for the individual sites.

Multistep methods are classically constructed by specially designed difference operators on an equidistant time grid. To make them practically useful, they have to be implemented by varying the step-size according to some error-control algorithm. It is well known how to extend Adams and BDF formulas to a variable step-size formulation. In this paper we present a collocation approach to construct variable step-size formulas. We make use of piecewise polynomials to show that every k-step method of order k+1 has a variable step-size polynomial collocation formulation", "1453": "Mobile banking's tough sell. Banks are having to put their mobile-commerce projects on hold because the essential technology to make the services usable, in particular GPRS (general packet radio service) hasn't become widely available.

In fact banking via WAP (wireless application protocol) has proved to be a frustrating and time-consuming process for the customer. Financial firms' hopes for higher mobile usage are stymied by the fact that improvements to the systems won't happen as fast as they want and the inadequacies of the system go beyond immature technology.

A mobile ad hoc network consists of a collection of wireless mobile nodes that are capable of communicating with each other without the use of a network infrastructure or any centralized administration. MANET is an emerging research area with practical applications. However, wireless MANET is particularly vulnerable due to its fundamental characteristics, such as open medium, dynamic topology, distributed cooperation, and constrained capability. Routing plays an important role in the security of the entire network. In general, routing security in wireless MANETs appears to be a problem that is not trivial to solve. In this article we study the routing security issues of MANETs, and analyze in detail one type of attack-the \"black hole\" problem-that can easily be employed against the MANETs.

A method of generating NC programs for the high-speed milling of moulds is investigated. Forging dies and injection moulds, whether plastic or aluminium, have a complex surface geometry. In addition they are made of steels of hardness as much as 30 or even 50 HRC. Since 1995, high-speed machining has been much adopted by the die-making industry, which with this technology can reduce its use of Sinking Electrodischarge Machining (SEDM). EDM, in general, calls for longer machining times. The use of high-speed machining makes it necessary to redefine the preliminary stages of the process. In addition, it affects the methodology employed in the generation of NC programs, which requires the use of high-level CAM software. The aim is to generate error-free programs that make use of optimum cutting strategies in the interest of productivity and surface quality. The final result is a more reliable manufacturing process. There are two risks in the use of high-speed milling on hardened steels. One of these is tool breakage, which may be very costly and may furthermore entail marks on the workpiece. The other is collisions between the tool and the workpiece or fixtures, the result of which may be damage to the ceramic bearings in the spindles. in order to minimize these risks it is necessary that new control and optimization steps be included in the CAM methodology. There are three things that the firm adopting high-speed methods should do. It should redefine its process engineering, it should systematize access by its CAM programmers to high-speed knowhow, and it should take up the use of process simulation tools. In the latter case, it will be very advantageous to use tools for the estimation of cutting forces. The new work methods proposed in this article have made it possible to introduce high speed milling (HSM) into the die industry. Examples are given of how the technique has been applied with CAM programming re-engineered as here proposed, with an explanation of the novel features and the results", "994": "Design and implementation of a flexible manufacturing control system using neural network. Design and implementation of a sequential controller based on the concept of artificial neural networks for a flexible manufacturing system are presented. The recurrent neural network (RNN) type is used for such a purpose. Contrary to the programmable controller, an RNN-based sequential controller is based on a definite mathematical model rather than depending on the experience and trial and error techniques. The proposed controller is also more flexible because it is not limited by the restrictions of the finite state automata theory. Adequate guidelines of how to construct an RNN-based sequential controller are presented. These guidelines are applied to different case studies. The proposed controller is tested by simulations and real-time experiments. These tests prove the successfulness of the proposed controller performances. Theoretical as well as experimental results are presented and discussed indicating that the proposed design procedure using Elman's RNN can be effective in designing a sequential controller for event-based type manufacturing systems.

The side milling of ruled surfaces using a conical milling cutter was studied. This is a field that has largely been ignored by research scientists, but it is much used in industry, especially to machine turbine blades. We first suggest an improved positioning with respect to the directrices of the ruled surface. As compared with the methods already developed for the cylindrical cutter, this positioning enables the error between the cutter and the work-piece to be reduced. An algorithm is then introduced to calculate error so one can determine the cutter dimensions (cone radius and angle) in order to respect the tolerance interval imposed by the design office. This study provides an opportunity to determine cutters with greater dimensions, thus alleviating bending problems during milling", "814": "A framework for image deblurring using wavelet packet bases. We show that the average over translations of an operator diagonal in a wavelet packet basis is a convolution. We also show that an operator diagonal in a wavelet packet basis can be decomposed into several operators of the same kind, each of them being better conditioned. We investigate the possibility of using such a convolution to approximate a given convolution (in practice an image blur). Then we use these approximations to deblur images. First, we show that this framework permits us to redefine existing deblurring methods. Then, we show that it permits us to define a new variational method which combines the wavelet packet and the total variation approaches. We argue and show by experiments that this permits us to avoid the drawbacks of both approaches which are, respectively, ringing and staircasing", "1414": "Survey says!

Constructing a confidence interval for a binomial proportion or the difference of two proportions is a routine exercise in daily data analysis. The best-known method is the Wald interval based on the asymptotic normal approximation to the distribution of the observed sample proportion, though it is known to have bad performance for small to medium sample sizes. Agresti et al. (1998, 2000) proposed an Adding-4 method: 4 pseudo-observations are added with 2 successes and 2 failures and then the resulting (pseudo-)sample proportion is used. The method is simple and performs extremely well. Here we propose an approximate method based on a t-approximation that takes account of the uncertainty in estimating the variance of the observed (pseudo-)sample proportion. It follows the same line of using a t-test, rather than z-test, in testing the mean of a normal distribution with an unknown variance. For some circumstances our proposed method has a higher coverage probability than the Adding-4 method", "1047": "Dynamics and control of initialized fractional-order systems. Due to the importance of historical effects in fractional-order systems, this paper presents a general fractional-order system and control theory that includes the time-varying initialization response. Previous studies have not properly accounted for these historical effects. The initialization response, along with the forced response, for fractional-order systems is determined. The scalar fractional-order impulse response is determined, and is a generalization of the exponential function. Stability properties of fractional-order systems are presented in the complex w-plane, which is a transformation of the s-plane. Time responses are discussed with respect to pole positions in the complex w-plane and frequency response behavior is included. A fractional-order vector space representation, which is a generalization of the state space concept, is presented including the initialization response.

We present an approach to significantly enhance the spectral resolution of imaging systems by generalizing image mosaicing. A filter transmitting spatially varying spectral bands is rigidly attached to a camera. As the system moves, it senses each scene point multiple times, each time in a different spectral band. This is an additional dimension of the generalized mosaic paradigm, which has demonstrated yielding high radiometric dynamic range images in a wide field of view, using a spatially varying density filter. The resulting mosaic represents the spectrum at each scene point. The image acquisition is as easy as in traditional image mosaics. We derive an efficient scene sampling rate, and use a registration method that accommodates the spatially varying properties of the filter. Using the data acquired by this method, we demonstrate scene rendering under different simulated illumination spectra. We are also able to infer information about the scene illumination.

According to previous studies, attitude towards information technology (IT) among small business owners appears to be a key factor in achieving high quality IT implementations. In an effort to extend this stream of research, we conducted case studies with small business owners and learned that high quality IT implementations resulted with owners who had positive or negative attitudes toward IT, but not with owners who had uncertain attitudes. Owners with apolar attitude, either positive or negative, all took action to temper the uncertainty and risk surrounding the use of new IT in their organization. In contrast, owners with uncertain attitudes did not make mitigating attempts to reduce uncertainty and risk. A consistent finding among those with high quality IT implementations was an entrepreneurial, or shared, management style. It is proposed, based on case study data, that small business owners with an uncertain attitude towards IT might experience higher quality IT results in their organizations through practicing a more entrepreneurial, or shared, management style.

This article presents a modeling and simulation methodology to analyze the performance of voice quality when sent over the available bit rate service in asynchronous transfer mode networks. Sources can modify the rate at which they send traffic to the network based on the feedback carried in the resource management cells. This is achieved by changing the encoding level. As the contention increases to network resources-bandwidth in this case-sources start reducing the rate at which they generate and send traffic. The efficiency of the scheme under different scheduling/drop policies and other operating conditions and environments is evaluated using simulation modeling.

Then, lines that intersect at one point are fitted to the edges in a Hough space. Consequently, the vanishing point is estimated robustly even when the lane markings are occluded by other vehicles.

This paper describes a new technique for two-dimensional (2-D) imaging of the motion vector at a very high frame rate with ultrasound. Its potential is experimentally demonstrated for transient elastography. But, beyond this application, it also could be promising for color flow and reflectivity imaging. To date, only axial displacements induced in human tissues by low-frequency vibrators were measured during transient elastography. The proposed technique allows us to follow both axial and lateral displacements during the shear wave propagation and thus should improve Young's modulus image reconstruction. The process is a combination of several ideas well-known in ultrasonic imaging: ultra-fast imaging, multisynthetic aperture beamforming, 1-D speckle tracking, and compound imaging. Classical beamforming in the transmit mode is replaced here by a single plane wave insonification increasing the frame rate by at least a factor of 128. The beamforming is achieved only in the receive mode on two independent subapertures. Comparison of successive frames by a classical 1-D speckle tracking algorithm allows estimation of displacements along two different directions linked to the subapertures beams. The variance of the estimates is finally improved by tilting the emitting plane wave at each insonification, thus allowing reception of successive decorrelated speckle patterns", "96": "OMS battle heating up as Chicago Equity ousts LongView for Macgregor.

Liang presented (1999) a fuzzy multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method based on the concepts of ideal and anti-ideal points. Despite its merits, Liang method has the following limitations: (i) the objective criteria are converted into dimensionless indices and the subjective criteria are not converted, which may prevent compatibility for these criteria, (ii) the formulas for converting objective criteria are not reliable, and (iii) an unreliable ranking method, i.e. maximizing set and minimizing set, is applied to rank the fuzzy numbers. This paper applies the Hsu and Chen method and suggests a fuzzy number ranking method to propose an improved fuzzy MCDM model based on ideal and anti-ideal concepts to overcome the shortcomings of the Liang method. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed ranking method and the improved model, respectively", "1073": "Quantum retrodiction in open systems. Quantum retrodiction involves finding the probabilities for various preparation events given a measurement event. This theory has been studied for some time but mainly as an interesting concept associated with time asymmetry in quantum mechanics. Recent interest in quantum communications and cryptography, however, has provided retrodiction with a potential practical application. For this purpose quantum retrodiction in open systems should be more relevant than in closed systems isolated from the environment. In this paper we study retrodiction in open systems and develop a general master equation for the backward time evolution of the measured state, which can be used for calculating preparation probabilities. We solve the master equation, by way of example, for the driven two-level atom coupled to the electromagnetic field", "134": "A model of periodic oscillation for genetic regulatory systems. In this paper, we focus on modeling and explaining periodic oscillations in gene-protein systems with a simple nonlinear model and on analyzing effects of time delay on the stability of oscillations. Our main model of genetic regulation comprises of a two-gene system with an autoregulatory feedback loop. We exploit multiple time scales and hysteretic properties of the model to construct periodic oscillations with jumping dynamics and analyze the possible mechanism according to the singular perturbation theory. As shown in this paper, periodic oscillations are mainly generated by nonlinearly negative and positive feedback loops in gene regulatory systems, whereas the jumping dynamics is generally caused by time scale differences among biochemical reactions. This simple model may actually act as a genetic oscillator or switch in gene-protein networks because the dynamics are robust for parameter perturbations or environment variations. We also explore effects of time delay on the stability of the dynamics, showing that the time delay generally increases the stability region of the oscillations, thereby making the oscillations robust to parameter changes. Two examples are also provided to numerically demonstrate our theoretical results", "79": "An efficient and stable ray tracing algorithm for parametric surfaces. In this paper, we propose an efficient and stable algorithm for finding ray-surface intersections. Newton's method and Bezier clipping are adapted to form the core of our algorithm. Ray coherence is used to find starting points for Newton iteration. We introduce an obstruction detection technique to verify whether an intersection point found using Newton's method is the closest. When Newton's method fails to achieve convergence, we use Bezier clipping substitution to find the intersection points. This combination achieves a significant improvement in tracing primary rays. A similar approach successfully improves the performance of tracing secondary rays", "1398": "Swamped by data [storage].

Options are financial instruments that depend on the underlying stock. We explain their non-Gaussian fluctuations using the nonextensive thermodynamics parameter q. A generalized form of the Black-Scholes (BS) partial differential equation (1973) and some closed-form solutions are obtained. The standard BS equation (q = 1) which is used by economists to calculate option prices requires multiple values of the stock volatility (known as the volatility smile). Using q = 1.5 which well models the empirical distribution of returns, we get a good description of option prices using a single volatility", "1034": "Vibration control of the rotating flexible-shaft/multi-flexible-disk system with the eddy-current damper. In this paper, the rotating flexible-Timoshenko-shaft/flexible-disk coupling system is formulated by applying the assumed-mode method into the kinetic and strain energies, and the virtual work done by the eddy-current damper. From Lagrange's equations, the resulting discretized equations of motion can be simplified as a bilinear system (BLS). Introducing the control laws, including the quadratic, nonlinear and optimal feedback control laws, into the BLS, it is found that the eddy-current damper can be used to suppress flexible and shear vibrations simultaneously, and the system is globally asymptotically stable. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis", "125": "A fast implementation of correlation of long data sequences for coherent receivers. Coherent reception depends upon matching of phase between the transmitted and received signal. Fast convolution techniques based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) are widely used for extracting time delay information from such matching. The latency in processing a large data window of the received signal is a serious overhead for mission critical real time applications. The implementation of a parallel algorithm for correlation of long data sequences in multiprocessor environment is demonstrated here. The algorithm does processing while acquiring the received signal and reduces the computation overhead considerably because of inherent parallelism", "1294": "Multicriterion optimization of composite laminates for maximum failure margins with an interactive descent algorithm. An interactive multicriterion optimization method for composite laminates subjected to multiple loading conditions is introduced.

We propose an experimentally feasible scheme to achieve quantum computation based on nonadiabatic geometric phase shifts, in which a cyclic geometric phase is used to realize a set of universal quantum gates. Physical implementation of this set of gates is designed for Josephson junctions and for NMR systems. Interestingly, we find that the nonadiabatic phase shift may be independent of the operation time under appropriate controllable conditions. A remarkable feature of the present nonadiabatic geometric gates is that there is no intrinsic limitation on the operation time", "1173": "A comprehensive chatter prediction model for face turning operation including tool wear effect. Presents a three-dimensional mechanistic frequency domain chatter model for face turning processes, that can account for the effects of tool wear including process damping. New formulations are presented to model the variation in process damping forces along nonlinear tool geometries such as the nose radius. The underlying dynamic force model simulates the variation in the chip cross-sectional area by accounting for the displacements in the axial and radial directions. The model can be used to determine stability boundaries under various cutting conditions and different states of flank wear. Experimental results for different amounts of wear are provided as a validation for the model", "864": "Valuing corporate debt: the effect of cross-holdings of stock and debt. We have developed a simple approach to valuing risky corporate debt when corporations own securities issued by other corporations. We assume that corporate debt can be valued as an option on corporate business asset value, and derive payoff functions when there exist cross-holdings of stock or debt between two firms. Next we show that payoff functions with multiple cross-holdings can be solved by the contraction principle. The payoff functions which we derive provide a number of insights about the risk structure of company cross-holdings. First, the Modigliani-Miller theorem can obtain when there exist cross-holdings between firms. Second, by establishing cross-shareholdings each of stock holders distributes a part of its payoff values to the bond holder of the other's firm, so that both firms can decrease credit risks by cross-shareholdings. In the numerical examples, we show that the correlation in firms can be a critical condition for reducing credit risk by cross-holdings of stock using Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, we show we can calculate the default spread easily when complicated cross-holdings exist, and find which shares are beneficial or disadvantageous", "7": "Anti-spam suit attempts to hold carriers accountable.

Temperatures are of interest in machining because cutting tools often fail by thermal softening or temperature-activated wear. Many models for cutting temperatures have been developed, but these models consider only simple tool geometries such as a rectangular slab with a sharp corner. This report describes a finite element study of tool temperatures in cutting that accounts for tool nose radius and included angle effects. A temperature correction factor model that can be used in the design and selection of inserts is developed to account for these effects. A parametric mesh generator is used to generate the finite element models of tool and inserts of varying geometries. The steady-state temperature response is calculated using NASTRAN solver. Several finite element analysis (FEA) runs are performed to quantify the effects of inserts included angle, nose radius, and materials for the insert and the tool holder on the cutting temperature at the insert rake face. The FEA results are then utilized to develop a temperature correction factor model that accounts for these effects. The temperature correction factor model is integrated with an analytical temperature model for rectangular inserts to predict cutting temperatures for contour turning with inserts of various shapes and nose radii. Finally, experimental measurements of cutting temperature using the tool-work thermocouple technique are performed and compared with the predictions of the new temperature model. The comparisons show good agreement", "776": "Information access for all: meeting the needs of deaf and hard of hearing people.

In this study, Poisson's equation is numerically evaluated by the element-by-element (EBE) finite-element method in a parallel environment using HPF 1.1 (High-Performance Fortran). In order to achieve high parallel efficiency, the data structures have been altered to node-based data instead of mixtures of node- and element-based data, representing a node-based EBE finite-element scheme (nEBE). The parallel machine used in this study was the NEC SX-4, and experiments were performed on a single node having 32 processors sharing common memory. The HPF compiler used in the experiments is HPF/SX Rev 2.0 released in 1997 (unofficial), which supports HPF 1.1. Models containing approximately 200 000 and 1,500,000 degrees of freedom were analyzed in order to evaluate the method. The calculation time, parallel efficiency, and memory used were compared. The performance of HPF in the conjugate gradient solver for the large model, using the NEC SX-4 compiler option-noshrunk, was about 85% that of the message passing interface", "938": "Fast accurate MEG source localization using a multilayer perceptron trained with real brain noise. Iterative gradient methods such as Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) are in widespread use for source localization from electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals. Unfortunately, LM depends sensitively on the initial guess, necessitating repeated runs. This, combined with LM's high per-step cost, makes its computational burden quite high. To reduce this burden, we trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a realtime localizer. We used an analytical model of quasistatic electromagnetic propagation through a spherical head to map randomly chosen dipoles to sensor activities according to the sensor geometry of a 4D Neuroimaging Neuromag-122 MEG system, and trained a MLP to invert this mapping in the absence of noise or in the presence of various sorts of noise such as white Gaussian noise, correlated noise, or real brain noise. A MLP structure was chosen to trade off computation and accuracy. This MLP was trained four times, with each type of noise. We measured the effects of initial guesses on LM performance, which motivated a hybrid MLP-start-LM method, in which the trained MLP initializes LM. We also compared the localization performance of LM, MLPs, and hybrid MLP-start-LMs for realistic brain signals. Trained MLPs are much faster than other methods, while the hybrid MLP-start-LMs are faster and more accurate than fixed-4-start-LM. In particular, the hybrid MLP-start-LM initialized by a MLP trained with the real brain noise dataset is 60 times faster and is comparable in accuracy to random-20-start-LM, and this hybrid system (localization error: 0.28 cm, computation time: 36 ms) shows almost as good performance as optimal-1-start-LM (localization error: 0.23 cm, computation time: 22 ms), which initializes LM with the correct dipole location. MLPs trained with noise perform better than the MLP trained without noise, and the MLP trained with real brain noise is almost as good an initial guesser for LM as the correct dipole location", "634": "An approximation to the F distribution using the chi-square distribution. For the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the F distribution, F(x; k, n), with associated degrees of freedom, k and n, a shrinking factor approximation (SFA), G( lambda kx; k), is proposed for large n and any fixed k, where G(x; k) is the chi-square c.d.f. with degrees of freedom, k, and lambda = lambda (kx; n) is the shrinking factor. Numerical analysis indicates that for n/k >or= 3, approximation accuracy of the SFA is to the fourth decimal place for most small values of k. This is a substantial improvement on the accuracy that is achievable using the normal, ordinary chi-square, and Scheffe-Tukey approximations. In addition, it is shown that the theoretical approximation error of the SFA, |F(x; k,n)-G( lambda kx; k)|, is O(1/n/sup 2/) uniformly over x", "771": "Pareto-optimal formulations for cost versus colorimetric accuracy trade-offs in printer color management. Color management for the printing of digital images is a challenging task, due primarily to nonlinear ink-mixing behavior and the presence of redundant solutions for print devices with more than three inks. Algorithms for the conversion of image data to printer-specific format are typically designed to achieve a single predetermined rendering intent, such as colorimetric accuracy. We present two CIELAB to CMYK color conversion schemes based on a general Pareto-optimal formulation for printer color management. The schemes operate using a 149-color characterization data set selected to efficiently capture the entire CMYK gamut. The first scheme uses artificial neural networks as transfer functions between the CIELAB and CMYK spaces. The second scheme is based on a reformulation of tetrahedral interpolation as an optimization problem. Characterization data are divided into tetrahedra for the interpolation-based approach using the program Qhull, which removes the common restriction that characterization data be well organized. Both schemes offer user control over trade-off problems such as cost versus reproduction accuracy, allowing for user-specified print objectives and the use of constraints such as maximum allowable ink and maximum allowable AE*/sub ab/. A formulation for minimization of ink is shown to be particularly favorable, integrating both a clipping and gamut compression features into a single methodology", "708": "Sufficient conditions on nonemptiness and boundedness of the solution set of the P/sub 0/ function nonlinear complementarity problem. The P/sub 0/ function nonlinear complementarity, problem (NCP) has attracted a lot of attention among researchers.

In this paper, by using the notion of an exceptional family of elements we develop a sufficient condition which ensures that the solution set of the P/sub 0/ function NCP is nonempty and bounded. In particular, we prove that many existing assumed conditions imply this sufficient condition. Thus, these conditions imply that the solution set of the P/sub 0/ function NCP is nonempty and bounded. In addition, we also prove directly that a few existence conditions imply that the solution set of the P/sub 0/ function NCP is bounded", "1329": "PageFlex + MediaRich = PageRich.

We also show that this result, patterned on Friedberg's famous theorem for the family of all c.e. sets, holds for the family of all n-c.e. sets for any n > 2. Second, it is stated that there exists an infinite family of d.c.e. sets without a Friedberg numbering. Third, it is shown that there exists an infinite family of c.e. sets (treated as a family of d.c.e. sets) with a numbering which is unique up to equivalence.

The internal rate of return (IRR) criterion is often used to evaluate profitability of investment projects. In this paper, we focus on a single-period project which consists of two types of cash flows; an investment at one period and a return at a succeeding period, and a financing at one period and a repayment at a succeeding period. We decompose the given investment project into a series of the single-period projects. From the viewpoint of the single-period project, we point out the applicability issue of the IRR criterion, namely the IRR criterion cannot be applied in which a project is composed of both investment type and financing type. Investigating the properties of a series of the single-period projects, we resolve the applicability issue of the IRR criterion and propose the decision procedure for profitability judgment toward any type of investment project based on the comparison between the IRR and the capital cost. We develop a new algorithm to obtain the value of the project investment rate (PIR) for the given project, which is a function of the capital cost, only using the standard IRR computing routine. This outcome is a theoretical breakthrough to widen the utilization of IRR in practical applications", "897": "Optimization of advertising expenses in the functioning of an insurance company.

We discuss the thesis of selective representing-the idea that the contents of the mental representations had by organisms are highly constrained by the biological niches within which the organisms evolved. While such a thesis has been defended by several authors elsewhere, our primary concern here is to take up the issue of the compatibility of selective representing and realism. We hope to show three things. First, that the notion of selective representing is fully consistent with the realist idea of a mind-independent world. Second, that not only are these two consistent, but that the latter (the realist conception of a mind-independent world) provides the most powerful perspective from which to motivate and understand the differing perceptual and cognitive profiles themselves. Third, that the (genuine and important) sense in which organism and environment may together constitute an integrated system of scientific interest poses no additional threat to the realist conception", "1348": "Reconstructing surfaces by volumetric regularization using radial basis functions. We present a new method of surface reconstruction that generates smooth and seamless models from sparse, noisy, nonuniform, and low resolution range data. Data acquisition techniques from computer vision, such as stereo range images and space carving, produce 3D point sets that are imprecise and nonuniform when compared to laser or optical range scanners. Traditional reconstruction algorithms designed for dense and precise data do not produce smooth reconstructions when applied to vision-based data sets. Our method constructs a 3D implicit surface, formulated as a sum of weighted radial basis functions. We achieve three primary advantages over existing algorithms: (1) the implicit functions we construct estimate the surface well in regions where there is little data, (2) the reconstructed surface is insensitive to noise in data acquisition because we can allow the surface to approximate, rather than exactly interpolate, the data, and (3) the reconstructed surface is locally detailed, yet globally smooth, because we use radial basis functions that achieve multiple orders of smoothness", "1011": "A self-organizing context-based approach to the tracking of multiple robot trajectories.

Processing of repeated/shared states is a hard problem that occurs very often in the domain of robotics. The proposed model consists of two groups of synaptic weights: competitive interlayer and Hebbian intralayer connections, which are responsible for encoding respectively the spatial and temporal features of the input sequence. Three additional mechanisms allow the network to deal with shared states: context units, neurons disabled from learning, and redundancy used to encode sequence states.

Consider a situation in which a quantum system is secretly prepared in a state chosen from the known set of states. We present a principle that gives a definite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the system and those that disturb the states. The principle is derived by alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a fundamental property of quantum ones. The principle can be cast into a simple form by using a decomposition of the relevant Hilbert space, which is uniquely determined by the set of possible states. The decomposition implies the classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state: one storing it classically, one storing it nonclassically, and the other one storing no information. Then the principle states that the nonclassical part is inaccessible and the classical part is read-only if we are to preserve the state of the system. From this principle, many types of no-cloning, no-broadcasting, and no-imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general forms including mixed states. It also gives a unified view on how various schemes of quantum cryptography work. The principle helps one to derive optimum amount of resources (bits, qubits, and ebits) required in data compression or in quantum teleportation of mixed-state ensembles", "961": "Modular and visual specification of hybrid systems: an introduction to HyCharts. Visual description techniques are particularly important for the design of hybrid systems, because specifications of such systems usually have to be discussed between engineers from a number of different disciplines. Modularity is vital for hybrid systems not only because it allows to handle large systems, but also because it permits to think in terms of components, which is familiar to engineers. Based on two different interpretations for hierarchic graphs and on a clear hybrid computation model, we develop HyCharts. HyCharts consist of two modular visual formalisms, one for the specification of the architecture and one for the specification of the behavior of hybrid systems. The operators on hierarchic graphs enable us to give a surprisingly simple denotational semantics for many concepts known from statechart-like formalisms. Due to a very general composition operator, HyCharts can easily be composed with description techniques from other engineering disciplines. Such heterogeneous system specifications seem to be particularly appropriate for hybrid systems because of their interdisciplinary character", "1391": "Government budget and accounting information policy and practice in Taiwan.

Arc instability is a very important determinant of weld quality. The instability behaviour of the gas-metal arc welding (GMAW) process is characterized by strong oscillations in arc length and current. In the paper, a model of the GMAW process is developed using an exact arc voltage characteristic. This model is used to study stability of the self-regulation process and to develop a simulation program that helps to understand the transient or dynamic nature of the GMAW process and relationships among current, electrode extension and contact tube-work distance. The process is shown to exhibit instabilities at both long electrode extension and normal extension. Results obtained from simulation runs of the model were also experimentally confirmed by the present author, as reported in this study. In order to explain the concept of the instability phenomena, the metal transfer mode and the arc voltage-current characteristic were examined.

If the quantum channels are subject to isotropic noise, the average fidelity decays to 1/2, which is smaller than the best possible value of 2/3 obtained only by the classical communication.

The Central Queensland University experience: 1999-2001. In the late eighties, the participation rate of women in information technology courses in most Australian Universities was around 25%. This low level of women's participation in computing courses occurs not only in Australia but also overseas. More studies indicate that the participation rates have not improved and in fact may be even further in decline. Participation rates in the workforce also appear to be in decline. Concerned at the imbalance within Australia, the Federal government directed all Australian Universities to increase the number of women in courses leading to a professional computing qualification (i.e., information technology courses) to 40% of students by 1995. This paper details one Australian university's approach, over a 10 year period (1991-2001), to redress this imbalance. We provide examples of intervention strategies developed and the outcomes for these strategies.

We consider the node-capacitated routing problem in an undirected ring network along with its fractional relaxation, the node-capacitated multicommodity flow problem. For the feasibility problem, Farkas' lemma provides a characterization for general undirected graphs, asserting roughly that there exists such a flow if and only if the so-called distance inequality holds for every choice of distance functions arising from nonnegative node weights. For rings, this (straightforward) result will be improved in two ways. We prove that, independent of the integrality of node capacities, it suffices to require the distance inequality only for distances arising from (0-1-2)-valued node weights, a requirement that will be called the double-cut condition. Moreover, for integer-valued node capacities, the double-cut condition implies the existence of a half-integral multicommodity flow. In this case there is even an integer-valued multicommodity flow that violates each node capacity by at most one. Our approach gives rise to a combinatorial, strongly polynomial algorithm to compute either a violating double-cut or a node-capacitated multicommodity flow. A relation of the problem to its edge-capacitated counterpart will also be explained", "1267": "3D reconstruction from uncalibrated-camera optical flow and its reliability evaluation.

Next, the flow is optimally corrected so that it satisfies the epipolar equation exactly. Finally, the 3D positions are computed, and their covariance matrices are evaluated.

The main outcomes were that the navigation aid used in the second version reduced the time taken to use the manual but increased the number of errors made by users. The navigational aid also seemed to reduce the perceived EOU compared with the first version. In both cases, the perceived EOU was lower than for a previous digital manual that had been developed using a task analysis and user input. The paper concludes by recommending the development of a generic task model of user interaction with digital maintenance manuals", "804": "Voltage control methods with grid connected wind turbines: a tutorial review. Within electricity grid networks it is conventional for large-scale central generators to both provide power and control grid node voltage.

This paper reviews the basic principles of voltage control for tutorial benefit and then considers application of grid-connected wind turbines for voltage control. The most widely used contemporary wind turbine types are considered and further detail is given for determining the range of variables that allow control", "830": "The real story behind Calpoint [telecom].

Manufacturing technologies, appropriately implemented, provide competitive advantage to manufacturers. The use of manufacturing technologies across countries is difficult to compare. One such comparison has been provided in the literature with a study of US and Japanese practices in advanced manufacturing technology use using a common questionnaire. The present study compares the use of 17 different technologies in similar industries in the USA (n=1025) and UK (n=166) using a common questionnaire. Largely, there are remarkable similarities between the two countries. This may partly correlate with the heavy traffic in foreign direct investment between the two nations. Notable differences are (1) across-the-board, US manufacturers are ahead of the UK firms in computerized integration with units inside and outside manufacturing organizations; (2) US manufacturers show higher labour productivity, which is consistent with macro-economic data, and (3) more UK manufacturers report the use of soft technologies such as just-in-time, total quality manufacturing and manufacturing cells.

A decision tree is considered to be appropriate (1) if the tree can classify the unseen data accurately, and (2) if the size of the tree is small. One of the approaches to induce such a good decision tree is to add new attributes and their values to enhance the expressiveness of the training data at the data pre-processing stage. There are many existing methods for attribute extraction and construction, but constructing new attributes is still an art. These methods are very time consuming, and some of them need a priori knowledge of the data domain. They are not suitable for data mining dealing with large volumes of data. We propose a novel approach that the knowledge on attributes relevant to the class is extracted as association rules from the training data. The new attributes and the values are generated from the association rules among the originally given attributes. We elaborate on the method and investigate its feature. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through some experiments", "1417": "Craigslist: virtual community maintains human touch. If it works why change it?

Feynman hesitated about the possibility of imitating fermion systems using such a device. Here we address some of his concerns and, in particular, investigate the simulation of fermionic systems.

The machining of complex parts typically involves a logical and chronological sequence of n operations on m machine tools. Because manufacturing datums cannot always match design constraints, some of the design specifications imposed on the part are usually satisfied by distinct subsets of the n operations prescribed in the process plan. Conventional tolerance control specifies a fixed set point for each operation and a permissible variation about this set point to insure compliance with the specifications, whereas sequential tolerance control (STC) uses real-time measurement information at the completion of one stage to reposition the set point for subsequent operations. However, it has been shown that earlier sphere-fitting methods for STC can lead to inferior solutions when the process distributions are skewed.

Polymorphic access rights make it possible to decrease the number of keys required to certify possession of complex access privileges that are defined in terms of several access rights. Multiple locks on the same access right allow us to exercise forms of selective revocation of access privileges.

The flow behind a vibrating flexible cable at low Reynolds numbers can exhibit complex wake structures such as lace-like patterns, vortex dislocations and frequency cells. These structures have been observed in experiments and numerical simulations, and are predicted by a previously developed low-order coupled map lattice (CML). The discrete (in time and space) CML models consist of a series of diffusively coupled circle map oscillators along the cable span. Motivated by a desire to modify the complex wake patterns behind flexible vibrating cables, we have studied the addition of control terms into the highly efficient CML models and explored the resulting dynamics. Proportional, adaptive proportional and discontinuous non-linear (DNL) control methods were used to derive the control laws. The first method employed occasional proportional feedback. The adaptive method used spatio-temporal feedback control. The DNL method used a discontinuous feedback linearization procedure, and the controller was designed for the resulting linearized system using eigenvalue assignment. These techniques were applied to a modeled vortex dislocation structure in the wake of a vibrating cable in uniform freestream flow. Parallel shedding patterns were achieved for a range of forcing frequency-forcing amplitude combinations studied to validate the control theory. The adaptive proportional and DNL methods were found to be more effective than the proportional control method due to the incorporation of a spatially varying feedback gain across the cylinder span. The DNL method was found to be the most efficient controller of the low-order CML model. The required control level across the cable span was correlated to the 1/1 lock-on behavior of the temporal circle map", "970": "Complex dynamics in nearly symmetric three-cell cellular neural networks.

Dependent types reflect the fact that validity of data is often a relative notion by allowing prior data to affect the types of subsequent data. Not only does this make for a precise type system, but also a highly generic one: both the type and the program for each instance of a family of operations can be computed from the data which codes for that instance. Recent experimental extensions to the Haskell type class mechanism give us strong tools to relativize types to other types. We may simulate some aspects of dependent typing by making counterfeit type-level copies of data, with type constructors simulating data constructors and type classes simulating datatypes.

Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning typically considers beam optimization and beam delivery as separate tasks. Following optimization, a multi-leaf collimator (MLC) or other beam delivery device is used to generate fluence patterns for patient treatment delivery. Due to limitations and characteristics of the MLC, the deliverable intensity distributions often differ from those produced by the optimizer, leading to differences between the delivered and the optimized doses. Objective function parameters are then adjusted empirically, and the plan is reoptimized to achieve a desired deliverable dose distribution. The resulting plan, though usually acceptable, may not be the best achievable. A method has been developed to incorporate the MLC restrictions into the optimization process. Our in-house IMRT system has been modified to include the calculation of the deliverable intensity into the optimizer. In this process, prior to dose calculation, the MLC leaf sequencer is used to convert intensities to dynamic MLC sequences, from which the deliverable intensities are then determined. All other optimization steps remain the same. To evaluate the effectiveness of deliverable-based optimization, 17 patient cases have been studied. Compared with standard optimization plus conversion to deliverable beams, deliverable-based optimization results show improved isodose coverage and a reduced dose to critical structures. Deliverable-based optimization results are close to the original nondeliverable optimization results, suggesting that IMRT can overcome the MLC limitations by adjusting individual beamlets. The use of deliverable-based optimization may reduce the need for empirical adjustment of objective function parameters and reoptimization of a plan to achieve desired results", "1377": "Open hypermedia for product support. As industrial systems become increasingly more complex, the maintenance and operating information increases both in volume and complexity.

This paper discusses some of the issues involved in, and the benefits of using, open hypermedia to manage and deliver a diverse range of information. While the paper concentrates on the problems specifically associated with manufacturing organizations, the problems are generic across other business sectors such as healthcare, defence and finance. The open hypermedia approach to information management and delivery allows a multimedia resource base to be used for a range of applications and it permits a user to have controlled access to the required information in an easily accessible and structured manner. Recent advancement in hypermedia also permits just-in-time support in the most appropriate format for all users. Our approach is illustrated by the discussion of a case study in which an open hypermedia system delivers maintenance and process information to factory-floor users to support the maintenance and operation of a very large manufacturing cell", "1242": "VPP Fortran and the design of HPF/JA extensions. VPP Fortran is a data parallel language that has been designed for the VPP series of supercomputers. In addition to pure data parallelism, it contains certain low-level features that were designed to extract high performance from user programs. A comparison of VPP Fortran and High-Performance Fortran (HPF) 2.0 shows that these low-level features are not available in HPF 2.0. The features include asynchronous interprocessor communication, explicit shadow, and the LOCAL directive. They were shown in VPP Fortran to be very useful in handling real-world applications, and they have been included in the HPF/JA extensions. They are described in the paper. The HPF/JA Language Specification Version 1.0 is an extension of HPF 2.0 to achieve practical performance for real-world applications and is a result of collaboration in the Japan Association for HPF (JAHPF). Some practical programming and tuning procedures with the HPF/JA Language Specification are described, using the NAS Parallel Benchmark BT as an example", "1445": "Applying BGL to computational geometry. The author applies Boost Graph Library to the domain of computational geometry. First, he formulates a concrete problem in graph terms. Second, he develops a way to transform the output of an existing algorithm into an appropriate Boost Graph Library data structure. Finally, he implements two new algorithms for my Boost Graph Library graph. The first algorithm gets the job done, but could have been written in any programming language. The second algorithm, however, shows the power of Boost Graph Library's generic programming approach.Graphs, graphics, and generic programming combine in this novel use of the Boost Graph Library", "133": "L/sub p/ stability and linearization. A theorem by Hadamard gives a two-part condition under which a map from one Banach space to another is a homeomorphism. The theorem, while often very useful, is incomplete in the sense that it does not explicitly specify the family of maps for which the condition is met. Recently, under a typically weak additional assumption on the map, it was shown that Hadamard's condition is met if and only if the map is a homeomorphism with a Lipschitz continuous inverse. Here, an application is given concerning the relation between the L/sub p/ stability (with 1 <or= p < infinity ) of a nonlinear system and the stability of related linear systems. We also give a result that directs attention to a fundamental limitation concerning what can be proved about linearization and stability for a related familiar family of feedback systems", "764": "Lattice Boltzmann schemes for quantum applications. We review the basic ideas behind the quantum lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), and present a few thoughts on the possible use of such an equation for simulating quantum many-body problems on both (parallel) electronic and quantum computers", "936": "Resonant controllers for smart structures. In this paper we propose a special type of colocated feedback controller for smart structures. The controller is a parallel combination of high-Q resonant circuits. Each of the resonant circuits is tuned to a pole (or the resonant frequency) of the smart structure. It is proven that the parallel combination of resonant controllers is stable with an infinite gain margin. Only one set of actuator-sensor can damp multiple resonant modes with the resonant controllers. Experimental results are presented to show the robustness of the proposed controller in damping multimode resonances", "1088": "Parallel implicit predictor corrector methods. The performance of parallel codes for the solution of initial value problems is usually strongly sensitive to the dimension of the continuous problem. This is due to the overhead related to the exchange of information among the processors and motivates the problem of minimizing the amount of communications. According to this principle, we define the so called Parallel Implicit Predictor Corrector Methods and in this class we derive A-stable, L-stable and numerically zero-stable formulas. The latter property refers to the zero-stability condition of a given formula when roundoff errors are introduced in its coefficients due to their representation in finite precision arithmetic. Some numerical experiment show the potentiality of this approach", "113": "Quantum limit on computational time and speed. We investigate if physical laws can impose limits on computational time and speed of a quantum computer built from elementary particles. We show that the product of the speed and the running time of a quantum computer is limited by the type of fundamental interactions present inside the system. This will help us to decide as to what type of interaction should be allowed in building quantum computers in achieving the desired speed", "1235": "Finding performance bugs with the TNO HPF benchmark suite. High-Performance Fortran (HPF) has been designed to provide portable performance on distributed memory machines. An important aspect of portable performance is the behavior of the available HPF compilers. Ideally, a programmer may expect comparable performance between different HPF compilers, given the same program and the same machine. To test the performance portability between compilers, we have designed a special benchmark suite, called the TNO HPF benchmark suite. It consists of a set of HPF programs that test various aspects of efficient parallel code generation. The benchmark suite consists of a number of template programs that are used to generate test programs with different array sizes, alignments, distributions, and iteration spaces. It ranges from very simple assignments to more complex assignments such as triangular iteration spaces, convex iteration spaces, coupled subscripts, and indirection arrays. We have run the TNO HPF benchmark suite on three compilers: the PREPARE prototype compiler, the PGI-HPF compiler, and the GMD Adaptor HPF compiler. Results show performance differences that can be quite large (up to two orders of magnitude for the same test program). Closer inspection reveals that the origin of most of the differences in performance is due to differences in local enumeration and storage of distributed array elements", "1257": "Definition of a similarity measure between cases based on auto/cross-fuzzy thesauri. A similarity measure between cases is needed in order to evaluate the degree of similarity when using past similar cases in order to resolve current problems. In similar case retrieval, multiple indices are set up in order to characterize the queries and individual cases, then terms are given as values to each. The similarity measure between cases commonly used is defined using the rate at which the values provided from the corresponding indices match. In practice, however, values cannot be expected to be mutually exclusive. As a result, a natural expansion of this approach is to have relationships in which mutually similar meanings are reflected in the similarity measure between cases. In this paper the authors consider an auto-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between corresponding indices and a cross-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between mutually distinct indices, then defines a similarity measure between cases which considers the relationship of index values based on these thesauri. This definition satisfies the characteristics required for the operation of case-based retrieval even when one value is not necessarily given in the index. Finally, using a test similar case retrieval system, the authors perform a comparative analysis of the proposed similarity measure between cases and a conventional approach", "557": "Noise and the PSTH response to current transients: II. Integrate-and-fire model with slow recovery and application to motoneuron data. For pt.I see ibid., vol.11, no.2 , p.135-151( 2001). A generalized version of the integrate-and-fire model is presented that qualitatively reproduces firing rates and membrane trajectories of motoneurons. The description is based on the spike-response model and includes three different time constants: the passive membrane time constant, a recovery time of the input conductance after each spike, and a time constant of the spike afterpotential. The effect of stochastic background input on the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) response to spike input is calculated analytically. Model results are compared with the experimental data of Poliakov et al. (1996). The linearized theory shows that the PSTH response to an input spike is proportional to a filtered version of the postsynaptic potential generated by the input spike. The shape of the filter depends on the background activity. The full nonlinear theory is in close agreement with simulated PSTH data", "1309": "Transcripts: bane or boon? [law reporting]. Because judge-made law, by its very nature, is less immediately accessible than the law of codified, statutory systems, it calls for an efficient system of law reporting. Of necessity, any such system will be selective, the majority of decisions going unreported. Considerable power thereby comes to repose in the hands of the law reporters. The author shares his invaluable perception and extensive research on the difficulties which arise from the excess of access to judgments", "1125": "Structure of weakly invertible semi-input-memory finite automata with delay 1. Semi-input-memory finite automata, a kind of finite automata introduced by the first author of this paper for studying error propagation, are a generalization of input memory finite automata by appending an autonomous finite automaton component. In this paper, we give a characterization of the structure of weakly invertible semi-input-memory finite automata with delay 1, in which the state graph of each autonomous finite automaton is a cycle. From a result on mutual invertibility of finite automata obtained by the authors recently, it leads to a characterization of the structure of feedforward inverse finite automata with delay 1", "1043": "Fractional motion control: application to an XY cutting table. In path tracking design, the dynamic of actuators must be taken into account in order to reduce overshoots appearing for small displacements. A new approach to path tracking using fractional differentiation is proposed with its application on a XY cutting table. It permits the generation of optimal movement reference-input leading to a minimum path completion time, taking into account both maximum velocity, acceleration and torque and the bandwidth of the closed-loop system. Fractional differentiation is used here through a Davidson-Cole filter. A methodology aiming at improving the accuracy especially on checkpoints is presented. The reference-input obtained is compared with spline function. Both are applied to an XY cutting table model and actuator outputs compared", "1234": "Achieving performance under OpenMP on ccNUMA and software distributed shared memory systems. OpenMP is emerging as a viable high-level programming model for shared memory parallel systems. It was conceived to enable easy, portable application development on this range of systems, and it has also been implemented on cache-coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access (ccNUMA) architectures. Unfortunately, it is hard to obtain high performance on the latter architecture, particularly when large numbers of threads are involved. In this paper, we discuss the difficulties faced when writing OpenMP programs for ccNUMA systems, and explain how the vendors have attempted to overcome them. We focus on one such system, the SGI Origin 2000, and perform a variety of experiments designed to illustrate the impact of the vendor's efforts. We compare codes written in a standard, loop-level parallel style under OpenMP with alternative versions written in a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) fashion, also realized via OpenMP, and show that the latter consistently provides superior performance. A carefully chosen set of language extensions can help us translate programs from the former style to the latter (or to compile directly, but in a similar manner). Syntax for these extensions can be borrowed from HPF, and some aspects of HPF compiler technology can help the translation process. It is our expectation that an extended language, if well compiled, would improve the attractiveness of OpenMP as a language for high-performance computation on an important class of modern architectures", "1300": "Will CPXe save the photofinishing market?.

It is also shown that defuzzifier based upon center of areas is not appropriate to the fuzzy systems based upon genuine many-valued implications", "651": "Application-layer multicasting with Delaunay triangulation overlays. Application-layer multicast supports group applications without the need for a network-layer multicast protocol. Here, applications arrange themselves in a logical overlay network and transfer data within the overlay. We present an application-layer multicast solution that uses a Delaunay triangulation as an overlay network topology. An advantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that it allows each application to locally derive next-hop routing information without requiring a routing protocol in the overlay. A disadvantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal. We present a protocol, called Delaunay triangulation (DT protocol), which constructs Delaunay triangulation overlay networks. We present measurement experiments of the DT protocol for overlay networks with up to 10 000 members, that are running on a local PC cluster with 100 Linux PCs. The results show that the protocol stabilizes quickly, e.g., an overlay network with 10 000 nodes can be built in just over 30 s. The traffic measurements indicate that the average overhead of a node is only a few kilobits per second if the overlay network is in a steady state. Results of throughput experiments of multicast transmissions (using TCP unicast connections between neighbors in the overlay network) show an achievable throughput of approximately 15 Mb/s in an overlay with 100 nodes and 2 Mb/s in an overlay with 1000 nodes", "1148": "Benchmarking of the Dose Planning Method (DPM) Monte Carlo code using electron beams from a racetrack microtron. A comprehensive set of measurements and calculations has been conducted to investigate the accuracy of the Dose Planning Method (DPM) Monte Carlo code for dose calculations from 10 and 50 MeV scanned electron beams produced from a racetrack microtron. Central axis depth dose measurements and a series of profile scans at various depths were acquired in a water phantom using a Scanditronix type RK ion chamber. Source spatial distributions for the Monte Carlo calculations were reconstructed from in-air ion chamber measurements carried out across the two-dimensional beam profile at 100 cm downstream from the source. The in-air spatial distributions were found to have full width at half maximum of 4.7 and 1.3 cm, at 100 cm from the source, for the 10 and 50 MeV beams, respectively. Energy spectra for the 10 and 50 MeV beams were determined by simulating the components of the microtron treatment head using the code MCNP4B. DPM calculations are on average within +or-2% agreement with measurement for all depth dose and profile comparisons conducted in this study. The accuracy of the DPM code illustrated in this work suggests that DPM may be used as a valuable tool for electron beam dose calculations", "1106": "Virtual projects at Halden [Reactor Project].

From the dawn of modern neural network theory, the mammalian cerebellum has been a favored object of mathematical modeling studies. Early studies focused on the fanout, convergence, thresholding, and learned weighting of perceptual-motor signals within the cerebellar cortex. This led to the still viable idea that the granule cell stage in the cerebellar cortex performs a sparse expansive recoding of the time-varying input vector. This recoding reveals and emphasizes combinations in a distributed representation that serves as a basis for the learned, state-dependent control actions engendered by cerebellar outputs to movement related centers. To make optimal use of available signals, the cerebellum must be able to sift the evolving state representation for the most reliable predictors of the need for control actions, and to use those predictors even if they appear only transiently and well in advance of the optimal time for initiating the control action. The paper proposes a modification to prior, population, models for cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing. Since it replaces a population with a single element, the proposed RSL model is in one sense maximally efficient, and therefore optimal from the perspective of scalability", "741": "Mothball mania [3G licences].

Double sampling (DS) X-control charts are designed to allow quick detection of a small shift of process mean and provides a quick response in an agile manufacturing environment. However, the DS X-control charts assume that the process standard deviation remains unchanged throughout the entire course of the statistical process control. Therefore, a complementary DS chart that can be used to monitor the process variation caused by changes in process standard deviation should be developed. In this paper, the development of the DS s-charts for quickly detecting small shift in process standard deviation for agile manufacturing is presented. The construction of the DS s-charts is based on the same concepts in constructing the DS X-charts and is formulated as an optimization problem and solved with a genetic algorithm. The efficiency of the DS s-control chart is compared with that of the traditional s-control chart. The results show that the DS s-control charts can be a more economically preferable alternative in detecting small shifts than traditional s-control charts", "112": "Revisiting Hardy's paradox: Counterfactual statements, real measurements, entanglement and weak values. Hardy's (1992) paradox is revisited. Usually the paradox is dismissed on grounds of counterfactuality, i.e., because the paradoxical effects appear only when one considers results of experiments which do not actually take place. We suggest a new set of measurements in connection with Hardy's scheme, and show that when they are actually performed, they yield strange and surprising outcomes. More generally, we claim that counterfactual paradoxes point to a deeper structure inherent to quantum mechanics", "1270": "A comparison of different decision algorithms used in volumetric storm cells classification. Decision algorithms useful in classifying meteorological volumetric radar data are discussed. Such data come from the radar decision support system (RDSS) database of Environment Canada and concern summer storms created in this country. Some research groups used the data completed by RDSS for verifying the utility of chosen methods in volumetric storm cells classification. The paper consists of a review of experiments that were made on the data from RDSS database of Environment Canada and presents the quality of particular classifiers. The classification accuracy coefficient is used to express the quality. For five research groups that led their experiments in a similar way it was possible to compare received outputs. Experiments showed that the support vector machine (SVM) method and rough set algorithms which use object oriented reducts for rule generation to classify volumetric storm data perform better than other classifiers", "906": "High-performance servo systems based on multirate sampling control.

On the other hand, the proposed feedback controller assures perfect disturbance rejection at M inter-sample points in the steady state.

In this paper, we propose an improved fuzzy system modeling algorithm to address some of the limitations of the existing approaches identified during our modeling with pharmacological data. This algorithm differs from the existing ones in its approach to the cluster validity problem (i.e., number of clusters), the projection schema (i.e., input membership assignment and rule determination), and significant input determination. The new algorithm is compared with the Bazoon-Turksen model, which is based on the well-known Sugeno-Yasukawa approach. The comparison was made in terms of predictive performance using two different data sets. The first comparison was with a two variable nonlinear function prediction problem and the second comparison was with a clinical pharmacokinetic modeling problem. It is shown that the proposed algorithm provides more precise predictions. Determining the degree of significance for each input variable, allows the user to distinguish their relative importance", "1211": "Hybrid decision tree. In this paper, a hybrid learning approach named hybrid decision tree (HDT) is proposed. HDT simulates human reasoning by using symbolic learning to do qualitative analysis and using neural learning to do subsequent quantitative analysis. It generates the trunk of a binary HDT according to the binary information gain ratio criterion in an instance space defined by only original unordered attributes. If unordered attributes cannot further distinguish training examples falling into a leaf node whose diversity is beyond the diversity-threshold, then the node is marked as a dummy node. After all those dummy nodes are marked, a specific feedforward neural network named FANNC that is trained in an instance space defined by only original ordered attributes is exploited to accomplish the learning task. Moreover, this paper distinguishes three kinds of incremental learning tasks. Two incremental learning procedures designed for example-incremental learning with different storage requirements are provided, which enables HDT to deal gracefully with data sets where new data are frequently appended. Also a hypothesis-driven constructive induction mechanism is provided, which enables HDT to generate compact concept descriptions", "956": "Do you see what I see? [visual technology in law firms].

The software and hardware components are easy to use, and they're increasingly affordable to boot. The next time you need to convey a point to an audience (be it one person or many), think of how you might benefit from the visual impact available through presentation software like PowerPoint.

Many approaches to case based reasoning (CBR) exploit feature weight setting algorithms to reduce the sensitivity to distance functions. We demonstrate that optimal feature weight setting in a special kind of CBR problems can be formalised as linear programming problems. Therefore, the optimal weight settings can be calculated in polynomial time instead of searching in exponential weight space using heuristics to get sub-optimal settings. We also demonstrate that our approach can be used to solve classification problems", "144": "Development of a 3.5 inch magneto-optical disk with a capacity of 2.3 GB.

An algorithm for wedged beams. A method is presented for calculation of a two-dimensional function, T/sub wedge/(x,y), describing the transmission of a wedged photon beam through a patient. This in an extension of the method that we have published for open (nonwedged) fields [Med. Phys. 25, 830-840 (1998)]. Transmission functions for open fields are being used in our clinic for prediction of portal dose images (PDI, i.e., a dose distribution behind the patient in a plane normal to the beam axis), which are compared with PDIs measured with an electronic portal imaging device (EPID). The calculations are based on the planning CT scan of the patient and on the irradiation geometry as determined in the treatment planning process. Input data for the developed algorithm for wedged beams are derived from (the already available) measured input data set for transmission prediction in open beams, which is extended with only a limited set of measurements in the wedged beam. The method has been tested for a PDI plane at 160 cm from the focus, in agreement with the applied focus-to-detector distance of our fluoroscopic EPIDs. For low and high energy photon beams (6 and 23 MV) good agreement (~1%) has been found between calculated and measured transmissions for a slab and a thorax phantom", "731": "Aggregate bandwidth estimation in stored video distribution systems. Multimedia applications like video on demand, distance learning, Internet video broadcast, etc. will play a fundamental role in future broadband networks. A common aspect of such applications is the transmission of video streams that require a sustained relatively high bandwidth with stringent requirements of quality of service. In this paper various original algorithms for evaluating, in a video distribution system, a statistical estimation of aggregate bandwidth needed by a given number of smoothed video streams are proposed and discussed. The variable bit rate traffic generated by each video stream is characterized by its marginal distribution and by conditional probabilities between rates of temporary closed streams. The developed iterative algorithms evaluate an upper and lower bound of needed bandwidth for guaranteeing a given loss probability. The obtained results are compared with simulations and with other results, based on similar assumptions, already presented in the literature. Some considerations on the developed algorithms are made, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods", "968": "Stabilization of global invariant sets for chaotic systems: an energy based control approach. This paper presents a new control approach for steering trajectories of three-dimensional nonlinear chaotic systems towards stable stationary states or time-periodic orbits. The proposed method mainly consists in a sliding mode-based control design that is extended by an explicit consideration of system energy as basis for both controller design and system stabilization. The control objective is then to regulate the energy with respect to a shaped nominal representation implicitly related to system trajectories. In this paper, we establish some theoretical results to introduce the control design approach referred to as energy based sliding mode control. Then, some capabilities of the proposed approach are illustrated through examples related to the chaotic circuit of Chua", "1069": "Entangling atoms in bad cavities. We propose a method to produce entangled spin squeezed states of a large number of atoms inside an optical cavity.

The paper has two intertwined parts. The first one is a proposal for a conceptual and theoretical framework to understand technical change in late industrializing economies. The second part develops a kind of empirical test of the usefulness of that new framework by means of a comparative study of the Brazilian and South Korean cases. All the four types of macroevidences of the technical change processes of Brazil and Korea corroborate, directly or indirectly, the hypothesis of the existence of actual cases of national learning systems (NLSs) of passive and active nature, as it is shown to be the cases of Brazil and South Korea, respectively. The contrast between the two processes of technical change prove remarkable, despite both processes being essentially confined to learning. The concepts of passive and active NLSs show how useful they are to apprehend the diversity of those realities, and, consequently, to avoid, for instance, interpretations that misleadingly suppose (based on conventional economic theory) that those countries have a similar lack of technological dynamism", "1314": "Multi-timescale Internet traffic engineering. The Internet is a collection of packet-based hop-by-hop routed networks. Internet traffic engineering is the process of allocating resources to meet the performance requirements of users and operators for their traffic.

This article motivates the need for traffic engineering in the Internet at other timescales, namely control and management timescales, and presents three mechanisms for this. It also presents a scenario to show how these mechanisms increase the flexibility of operators' service offerings and potentially also ease problems of Internet management", "939": "Image reconstruction from fan-beam projections on less than a short scan. This work is concerned with 2D image reconstruction from fan-beam projections. It is shown that exact and stable reconstruction of a given region-of-interest in the object does not require all lines passing through the object to be measured. Complete (non-truncated) fan-beam projections provide sufficient information for reconstruction when 'every line passing through the region-of-interest intersects the vertex path in a non-tangential way'. The practical implications of this condition are discussed and a new filtered-backprojection algorithm is derived for reconstruction.

Convolutive blind source separation and adaptive beamforming have a similar goal-extracting a source of interest (or multiple sources) while reducing undesired interferences. A benefit of source separation is that it overcomes the conventional cross-talk or leakage problem of adaptive beamforming. Beamforming on the other hand exploits geometric information which is often readily available but not utilized in blind algorithms. We propose to join these benefits by combining cross-power minimization of second-order source separation with geometric linear constraints used in adaptive beamforming. We find that the geometric constraints resolve some of the ambiguities inherent in the independence criterion such as frequency permutations and degrees of freedom provided by additional sensors. We demonstrate the new method in performance comparisons for actual room recordings of two and three simultaneous acoustic sources", "959": "Silicon debug of a PowerPC TM microprocessor using model checking. When silicon is available, newly designed microprocessors are tested in specially equipped hardware laboratories, where real applications can be run at hardware speeds. However, the large volumes of code being run, plus the limited access to the internal nodes of the chip, make it very difficult to characterize the nature of any failures that occur. We describe how temporal logic model checking was used to quickly characterize a design error exhibited during hardware testing of a PowerPC microprocessor. We outline the conditions under which model checking can efficiently characterize such failures, and show how the particular error we detected could have been revealed early in the design cycle, by model checking a short and simple correctness specification. We discuss the implications of this for verification methodologies over the full design cycle", "1158": "From powder to perfect parts.

By solid balls, we mean a set of balls in R/sup 3/ no two of which can penetrate each other.

(We may omit the chain if the two red balls are already tangent.) The ball number b(G) of G is the minimum number of balls (red and blue) necessary to represent G. If we put the balls and chains on a table so that all balls sit on the table, then the minimum number of balls for G is denoted by bT(G). Among other things, we prove that b(K/sub 6/) = 8, b(K/sub 7/) = 13 and b/sub T/(K/sub 5/) = 8,b/sub T/(K/sub 6/) = 14.

If a prediction sample is different from the calibration samples, it can be considered as an outlier in prediction. In this work, two techniques, the use of uncertainty estimation and the convex hull method are studied to detect such prediction outliers. Classical techniques (Mahalanobis distance and X-residuals), potential functions and robust techniques are used for comparison. It is concluded that the combination of the convex hull method and uncertainty estimation offers a practical way for detecting outliers in prediction. By adding the potential function method, inliers can also be detected", "934": "Induced-shear piezoelectric actuators for rotor blade trailing edge flaps. Much of the current rotorcraft research is focused on improving performance by reducing unwanted helicopter noise and vibration. One of the most promising active rotorcraft vibration control systems is an active trailing edge flap. In this paper, an induced-shear piezoelectric tube actuator is used in conjunction with a simple lever-cusp hinge amplification device to generate a useful combination of trailing edge flap deflections and hinge moments. A finite-element model of the actuator tube and trailing edge flap (including aerodynamic and inertial loading) was used to guide the design of the actuator-flap system. A full-scale induced shear tube actuator flap system was fabricated and bench top testing was conducted to validate the analysis. Hinge moments corresponding to various rotor speeds were applied to the actuator using mechanical springs. The testing demonstrated that for an applied electric field of 3 kV cm/sup -1/ the tube actuator deflected a representative full-scale 12 inch flap +or-2.8 degrees at 0 rpm and +or-1.4 degrees for a hinge moment simulating a 400 rpm condition. The per cent error between the predicted and experimental full-scale flap deflections ranged from 4% (low rpm) to 12.5% (large rpm). Increasing the electric field to 4 kV cm/sup -1/ results in +or-2.5 degrees flap deflection at a rotation speed of 400 rpm, according to the design analysis. A trade study was conducted to compare the performance of the piezoelectric tube actuator to the state of the art in trailing edge flap actuators and indicated that the induced-shear tube actuator shows promise as a trailing edge flap actuator", "1105": "Fuzzy business [Halden Reactor Project]. The Halden Reactor Project has developed two systems to investigate how signal validation and thermal performance monitoring techniques can be improved. PEANO is an online calibration monitoring system that makes use of artificial intelligence techniques. The system has been tested in cooperation with EPRI and Edan Engineering, using real data from a US PWR plant. These tests showed that PEANO could reliably assess the performance of the process instrumentation at different plant conditions. Real cases of zero and span drifts were successfully detected by the system. TEMPO is a system for thermal performance monitoring and optimisation, which relies on plant-wide first principle models. The system has been installed on a Swedish BWR plant. Results obtained show an overall rms deviation from measured values of a few tenths of a percent, and giving goodness-of-fits in the order of 95%.

We tested the adequacy of a videoconferencing system using a single integrated systems digital network (ISDN) line (128 kilobits per second) for the remote diagnosis of children with suspected congenital heart disease (CHD). Real-time echocardiogram interpretation was compared to subsequent videotape review in 401 studies with concordance in 383 (95.5%) studies. A new diagnosis of CHD was made in 98 studies. Immediate patient transfer was arranged based upon a real-time diagnosis in five studies. In 300 studies, a normal diagnosis obviated further evaluation.

A new algorithm, devoted to molecular descriptor selection in the context of data mining problems, has been developed. This algorithm is based on the concepts of genetic algorithms (GA) for descriptor hyperspace exploration and combined with a stepwise approach to get local convergence. Its selection power was evaluated by a fitness function derived from a fuzzy clustering method. Different training and test sets were randomly generated at each GA generation. The fitness score was derived by combining the scores of the training and test sets. The ability of the proposed algorithm to select relevant subsets of descriptors was tested on two data sets.

Much has been written about the leaky pipeline of women in computer science (CS), with the percentage of women decreasing as one moves from lower levels, such as college, to higher levels, culminating in full professorship. While significant attention focused on keeping women from leaving the pipeline, there is also an opportunity to bring women into the pipeline through non-traditional programs, instead of requiring that everyone enter at the undergraduate level. Both Mills College, a small liberal arts institution for women, and UC Berkeley, a large research university, established programs in the 80's to increase the number of women in computer science by tapping non-traditional students. Both programs share the core value of accommodating older students lacking technical backgrounds. The two programs have produced similar results: graduate degrees earned in computer science by students who would not have qualified without these programs, professional employment in the computer science field by women and minorities, and a recognition that this population represents a rich source of talent for our nation", "95": "SIA shelves T+1 decision till 2004.

The teaching of electronic commerce in universities has become a growth industry in itself. The rapid expansion of electronic commerce programmes raises the question of what actually is being taught. The association of electronic commerce as primarily a technical or information technology (IT) phenomenon has not been sufficient to constrain it to IT and information systems departments. Business schools have been keen entrants into the electronic commerce coursework race and they are developing electronic commerce programmes in an environment where there is no agreed definition of the term. This paper draws on the work of Kenneth Boulding who argued that the dynamics of change in society are largely a product of changing skills and the way these skills are arranged into roles at the organizational level. It is argued that an overly technical interpretation of electronic commerce narrows the skills being acquired as part of formal education. Universities, under pressure from the market and technological change, are changing their roles resulting in a further narrowing of the breadth of issues that is seen as legitimate to be included as electronic commerce. The outcome is that aspiring electronic commerce professionals are not being exposed to a wide enough agenda of ideas and concepts that will assist them to make better business decisions", "1452": "Creating Web-based listings of electronic journals without creating extra work. Creating up-to-date listings of electronic journals is challenging due to frequent changes in titles available and in URLs for electronic journal titles.

This case study examines the development of a system which automatically exports data from the online catalog and incorporates it into dynamically-generated Web sites. These sites provide multiple access points for journals, include Web-based interfaces enabling subject specialists to manage the list of titles which appears in their subject area. Because data are automatically extracted from the catalog, overlap in updating titles and URLs is avoided. Following the creation of this system, usage of electronic journals dramatically increased and feedback has been positive. Future challenges include developing more frequent updates and motivating subject specialists to more regularly monitor new titles", "143": "An automated irradiation device for use in cyclotrons.

We analyze the stability of the characteristic polynomials whose coefficients are polynomials of interval parameters via monotonicity methods. Our stability conditions are based on Frazer-Duncan's theorem and all conditions can be checked using only endpoint values of interval parameters. These stability conditions are necessary and sufficient under the monotonicity assumptions. When the monotonicity conditions do not hold on the whole parameter region, we present an interval division method and a transformation algorithm in order to apply the monotonicity conditions. Then, our stability analysis methods can be applied to all characteristic polynomials whose coefficients are polynomials of interval parameters", "1261": "Topology-adaptive modeling of objects using surface evolutions based on 3D mathematical morphology. Level set methods were proposed mainly by mathematicians for constructing a model of a 3D object of arbitrary topology. However, those methods are computationally inefficient due to repeated distance transformations and increased dimensions. In the paper, we propose a new method of modeling fast objects of arbitrary topology by using a surface evolution approach based on mathematical morphology. Given sensor data covering the whole object surface, the method begins with an initial approximation of the object by evolving a closed surface into a model topologically equivalent to the real object. The refined approximation is then performed using energy minimization. The method has been applied in several experiments using range data, and the results are reported in the paper", "880": "Computing 2002: democracy, education, and the future.

The author considers how women and girls of the world have been neither educated for computing nor served by computing. Globally, women's participation in computer science grew for a while, then dropped precipitously. Computing, science, engineering, and society will suffer if this decline continues, because women have different perspectives on technology, what it is important for, how it should be built, which projects should be funded, and so on.

Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast MRI is a potential method for a physiological characterization of tissue beyond mere morphological representation. The purpose of this study was to develop evaluation techniques for such examinations using a hyperoxia challenge. Administration of pure oxygen was applied to test these techniques, as pure oxygen can be expected to induce relatively small signal intensity (SI) changes compared to CO/sub 2/-containing gases and thus requires very sensitive evaluation methods. Fourteen volunteers were investigated by alternating between breathing 100% O/sub 2/ and normal air, using two different paradigms of administration. Changes ranged from >30% in large veins to 1.71%+or-0.14% in basal ganglia and 0.82%+or-0.08% in white matter. To account for a slow physiological response function, a reference for correlation analysis was derived from the venous reaction. An objective method is presented that allows the adaptation of the significance threshold to the complexity of the paradigm used. Reference signal characteristics in representative brain tissue regions were established. As the presented evaluation scheme proved its applicability to small SI changes induced by pure oxygen, it can readily be used for similar experiments with other gases", "1013": "A scalable intelligent takeoff controller for a simulated running jointed leg.

The SI weight is then used to reconstruct images from the data calculated on a random trajectory in a numerical phantom case and from the data acquired on interleaved spirals in an in vivo experiment, respectively. In addition, Pipe and Menon's weight (MRM 1999;41:179-186) is also used in the reconstructions to make a comparison.

Weighted factors analysis (WeFA) has been proposed as a new approach for elicitation, representation, and manipulation of knowledge about a given problem, generally at a high and strategic level. Central to this proposal is that a group of experts in the area of the problem can identify a hierarchy of factors with positive or negative influences on the problem outcome. The tangible output of WeFA is a directed weighted graph called a WeFA graph. This is a set of nodes denoting factors that can directly or indirectly influence an overall aim of the graph. The aim is also represented by a node. Each directed arc is a direct influence of one factor on another. A chain of directed arcs indicates an indirect influence. The influences may be identified as either positive or negative. For example, sales and costs are two factors that influence the aim of profitability in an organization. Sales has a positive influence on profitability and costs has a negative influence on profitability. In addition, the relative significance of each influence is represented by a weight. We develop Binary WeFA which is a variant of WeFA where the factors in the graph are restricted to being either true or false. Imposing this restriction on a WeFA graph allows us to be more precise about the meaning of the graph and of reasoning in it. Binary WeFA is a new proposal that provides a formal yet sufficiently simple language for logic-based argumentation for use by business people in decision-support and knowledge management. Whilst Binary WeFA is expressively simpler than other logic-based argumentation formalisms, it does incorporate a novel formalization of the notion of significance", "976": "Completion to involution and semidiscretisations. We discuss the relation between the completion to involution of linear over-determined systems of partial differential equations with constant coefficients and the properties of differential algebraic equations obtained by their semidiscretisation.

We also demonstrate how the formal theory can be used to obtain an existence and uniqueness theorem for smooth solutions of strongly hyperbolic systems and to estimate the drift off the constraints, if an underlying equation is numerically solved. Finally, we show for general linear systems how the index of differential algebraic equations obtained by semidiscretisations can be predicted from the result of a completion of the partial differential system", "122": "A formal framework for viewpoint consistency. Multiple viewpoint models of system development are becoming increasingly important. Each viewpoint offers a different perspective on the target system and system development involves parallel refinement of the multiple views.

Our work particularly focuses on the use of viewpoints in open distributed processing (ODP) which is an ISO/ITU standardisation framework. The requirements of viewpoint modelling in ODP are very broad and, hence, demanding. Multiple viewpoints, though, prompt the issue of consistency between viewpoints. This paper describes a very general interpretation of consistency which we argue is broad enough to meet the requirements of consistency in ODP. We present a formal framework for this general interpretation; highlight basic properties of the interpretation and locate restricted classes of consistency. Strategies for checking consistency are also investigated. Throughout we illustrate our theory using the formal description technique LOTOS.

A prerequisite for accurate dose delivery of IMRT profiles produced with dynamic multileaf collimation (DMLC) is highly accurate leaf positioning. In our institution, leaf verification for DMLC was initially done with film and ionization chamber. To overcome the limitations of these methods, a fast, accurate and two-dimensional method for daily leaf verification, using our CCD-camera based electronic portal imaging device (EPID), has been developed. This method is based on a flat field produced with a 0.5 cm wide sliding gap for each leaf pair. Deviations in gap widths are detected as deviations in gray scale value profiles derived from the EPID images, and not by directly assessing leaf positions in the images. Dedicated software was developed to reduce the noise level in the low signal images produced with the narrow gaps. The accuracy of this quality assurance procedure was tested by introducing known leaf position errors. It was shown that errors in leaf gap as small as 0.01-0.02 cm could be detected, which is certainly adequate to guarantee accurate dose delivery of DMLC treatments, even for strongly modulated beam profiles. Using this method, it was demonstrated that both short and long term reproducibility in leaf positioning were within 0.01 cm (1 sigma ) for all gantry angles, and that the effect of gravity was negligible", "795": "Approximation and complexity.

In a similar way, to construct functions in U we allow integration, addition, and multiplication of functions already constructed in U and multiplication by rational numbers.

In this paper, we propose a new method for implementing pipelined finite-impulse response (FIR) adaptive digital filter (ADF), with an aim of reducing the maximum delay of the filtering portion of conventional delayed least mean square (DLMS) pipelined ADF. We achieve a filtering section with a maximum delay of one by simplifying a pre-upsampled and a post-downsampled FIR filter using the concept of classification of coefficients. This reduction is independent of the order of the filter, which is an advantage when the order of the filter is very large, and as a result the method can also be applied to infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. Furthermore, when the proposed method is compared with the transpose ADF, which has a filtering section with zero delay, it is realized that it significantly reduces the maximum delay associated with updating the coefficients of FIR ADF. The effect of this is that, the proposed method exhibits a higher convergence speed in comparison to the transpose FIR ADF", "1141": "Reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position. Purpose: In breast conserving therapy, complete excision of the tumor with an acceptable cosmetic outcome depends on accurate localization in terms of both the position of the lesion and its extent. We hypothesize that preoperative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the patient in a supine position may be used for accurate tumor localization and marking of its extent immediately prior to surgery. Our aims in this study are to assess the reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position, to evaluate the effect of a breast immobilization device, and to derive reproducibility margins that take internal tissue shifts into account occurring between repeat setups. Materials Methods: The reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position is estimated by quantification of tissue shifts in the breasts of healthy volunteers between repeat MR setups. For each volunteer fiducials are identified and registered with their counter locations in corresponding MR volumes. The difference in position denotes the shift of breast tissue. The dependence on breast volume and the part of the breast, as well as the effect of a breast immobilization cast are studied. Results: The tissue shifts are small with a mean standard deviation on the order of 1.5 mm, being slightly larger in large breasts (V>1000 cm/sup 3/), and in the posterior part (toward the pectoral muscle) of both small and large breasts. The application of a breast immobilization cast reduces the tissue shifts in large breasts. A reproducibility margin on the order of 5 mm will take the internal tissue shifts into account that occur between repeat setups. Conclusion: The results demonstrate a high reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position", "1349": "Efficient simplicial reconstructions of manifolds from their samples. An algorithm for manifold learning is presented. Given only samples of a finite-dimensional differentiable manifold and no a priori knowledge of the manifold's geometry or topology except for its dimension, the goal is to find a description of the manifold. The learned manifold must approximate the true manifold well, both geometrically and topologically, when the sampling density is sufficiently high. The proposed algorithm constructs a simplicial complex based on approximations to the tangent bundle of the manifold. An important property of the algorithm is that its complexity depends on the dimension of the manifold, rather than that of the embedding space. Successful examples are presented in the cases of learning curves in the plane, curves in space, and surfaces in space; in addition, a case when the algorithm fails is analyzed", "1197": "Numerical behaviour of stable and unstable solitary waves. In this paper we analyse the behaviour in time of the numerical approximations to solitary wave solutions of the generalized Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation. This equation possesses an important property: the stability of these solutions depends on their velocity. We identify the error propagation mechanisms in both the stable and unstable case. In particular, we show that in the stable case, numerical methods that preserve some conserved quantities of the problem are more appropriate for the simulation of this kind of solutions", "842": "The incredible shrinking pipeline.

The selection of the optimal checkpointing interval has been a very critical issue in implementing checkpointing-recovery schemes for fault tolerant distributed systems. This paper presents a new scheme that allows a process to select the proper checkpointing interval dynamically. A process in the system evaluates the cost of checkpointing and possible rollback for each checkpointing interval and selects the proper time interval for the next checkpointing. Unlike the other schemes, the overhead incurred by both the checkpointing and rollback activities are considered for the cost evaluation, and the current communication pattern is reflected in the selection of the checkpointing interval. Moreover, the proposed scheme requires no extra message communication for the checkpointing interval selection and can easily be incorporated into the existing checkpointing coordination schemes", "544": "Virtual reality treatment of flying phobia. Flying phobia (FP) might become a very incapacitating and disturbing problem in a person's social, working, and private areas. Psychological interventions based on exposure therapy have proved to be effective, but given the particular nature of this disorder they bear important limitations. Exposure therapy for FP might be excessively costly in terms of time, money, and efforts. Virtual reality (VR) overcomes these difficulties as different significant environments might be created, where the patient can interact with what he or she fears while in a totally safe and protected environment, the therapist's consulting room.

Based on the National Center for Education Statistics (2000), in the 1997-1998 academic year 26.7% of earned bachelors' degrees, 29.0% of earned masters' degrees and 16.3% of earned doctorates' degrees in computer science were awarded to women. As these percentages suggest, women are underrepresented at all academic levels in computer science (Camp, 1997). The most severe shortage occurs at the top level-the doctorate in computer science. We know very little about the women who persist to the top level of academic achievement in computer science. This paper examines a subset of data collected through the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). The specific focus of this paper is to identify trends that have emerged from the SED with respect to females completing doctorates in computer science between the academic years 1990-1991 and 1999-2000. Although computer science doctorates include doctorates in information science, prior research (Camp, 1997) suggests that the percentage of women completing doctorates in information science as compared to computer science is low. The specific research questions are: 1. How does the percentage of women who complete doctorates in computer science compare to those that complete doctorates in other fields? 2. How does the length of time in school and the sources of funding differ for females as compared to males who complete doctorates in computer science? 3. Where do women go after completing doctorates in computer science and what positions do they acquire? How do these experiences differ from their male peers?", "1009": "Robust output feedback model predictive control using off-line linear matrix inequalities. A fundamental question about model predictive control (MPC) is its robustness to model uncertainty. In this paper, we present a robust constrained output feedback MPC algorithm that can stabilize plants with both polytopic uncertainty and norm-bound uncertainty. The design procedure involves off-line design of a robust constrained state feedback MPC law and a state estimator using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Since we employ an off-line approach for the controller design which gives a sequence of explicit control laws, we are able to analyze the robust stabilizability of the combined control laws and estimator, and by adjusting the design parameters, guarantee robust stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of constraints. The algorithm is illustrated with two examples", "1289": "Combining PC control and HMI. Integrating PC-based control with human machine interface (HMI) technology can benefit a plant floor system.

Dial-a-ride systems involve dispatching a vehicle to satisfy demands from a set of customers who call a vehicle-operating agency requesting that an item tie picked up from a specific location and delivered to a specific destination.

It is common to have maximum wait time constraints and maximum ride time constraints. In the presence of maximum wait time and maximum ride time restrictions, it is not clear how to efficiently determine, given a sequence of pickups and deliveries, whether a feasible schedule exists.

The dynamic vibration absorber (DVA) is a passive vibration control device which is attached to a vibrating body (called a primary system) subjected to exciting force or motion. In this paper, we will discuss an optimization problem of the three-element type DVA on the basis of the H/sub 2/ optimization criterion. The objective of the H/sub 2/ optimization is to reduce the total vibration energy of the system for overall frequencies; the total area under the power spectrum response curve is minimized in this criterion. If the system is subjected to random excitation instead of sinusoidal excitation, then the H/sub 2/ optimization is probably more desirable than the popular H/sub infinity / optimization. In the past decade there has been increasing interest in the three-element type DVA. However, most previous studies on this type of DVA were based on the H/sub infinity / optimization design, and no one has been able to find the algebraic solution as of yet. We found a closed-form exact solution for a special case where the primary system has no damping. Furthermore, the general case solution including the damped primary system is presented in the form of a numerical solution. The optimum parameters obtained here are compared to those of the conventional Voigt type DVA. They are also compared to other optimum parameters based on the H/sub infinity / criterion", "1131": "A min-max theorem on feedback vertex sets. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the linear system {x : Hx >or= e, x >or= 0} associated with a bipartite tournament to be totally dual integral, where H is the cycle-vertex incidence matrix and e is the all-one vector. The consequence is a min-max relation on packing and covering cycles, together with strongly polynomial time algorithms for the feedback vertex set problem and the cycle packing problem on the corresponding bipartite tournaments. In addition, we show that the feedback vertex set problem on general bipartite tournaments is NP-complete and approximable within 3.5 based on the min-max theorem", "1014": "Modelling of complete robot dynamics based on a multi-dimensional, RBF-like neural architecture.

The neural architecture is hierarchically organised to reach optimal adjustment to structural a priori-knowledge about the identification problem. The model structure is substantially simplified by general system analysis independent of robot type. But also a lot of specific features of the utilised experimental robot are taken into account.

The term decentralized integral controllability (DIC) pertains to the existence of stable decentralized controllers with integral action that have closed-loop properties such as stable independent detuning. It is especially useful to select control structures systematically at the early stage of control system design because the only information needed for DIC is the steady-state process gain matrix. Here, a necessary and sufficient condition conjectured in the literature is proved. The real structured singular value which can exploit realness of the controller gain is used to describe computable conditions for DIC. The primary usage of DIC is to eliminate unworkable pairings. For this, two other simple necessary conditions are proposed. Examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed conditions for DIC", "1284": "A linear time special case for MC games.

To what extent?. This paper deals with two questions: Does social capital determine innovation in manufacturing firms? If it is the case, to what extent? To deal with these questions, we review the literature on innovation in order to see how social capital came to be added to the other forms of capital as an explanatory variable of innovation. In doing so, we have been led to follow the dominating view of the literature on social capital and innovation which claims that social capital cannot be captured through a single indicator, but that it actually takes many different forms that must be accounted for. Therefore, to the traditional explanatory variables of innovation, we have added five forms of structural social capital (business network assets, information network assets, research network assets, participation assets, and relational assets) and one form of cognitive social capital (reciprocal trust).

In previous work by the first author, it has been established that a dichotomically stable discretization is needed when solving a stiff boundary-value problem in ordinary differential equations (ODEs), when sharp boundary layers may occur at each end of the interval. A dichotomically stable implicit Runge-Kutta method, using the 3-stage, fourth-order, Lobatto IIIA formulae, has been implemented in a variable step-size initial-value integrator, which could be used in a multiple-shooting approach. In the case of index-one differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) the use of the Lobatto IIIA formulae has an advantage, over a comparable Gaussian method, that the order is the same for both differential and algebraic variables, and there is no need to treat them separately. The ODE integrator has been adapted for the solution of index-one DAEs, and the resulting integrator (SYMDAE) has been inserted into the multiple-shooting code (MSHDAE) previously developed by R. Lamour for differential-algebraic boundary-value problems. The standard version of MSHDAE uses a BDF integrator, which is not dichotomically stable, and for some stiff test problems this fails to integrate across the interval of interest, while the dichotomically stable integrator SYMDAE encounters no difficulty. Indeed, for such problems, the modified version of MSHDAE produces an accurate solution, and within limits imposed by computer word length, the efficiency of the solution process improves with increasing stiffness.

The measurement set-up utilizes the global positioning system satellite constellation in 'common view' between two similar timing stations: one acts as a time server for the other, so the final timing difference at the second station represents the total synch error through the internet. Data recorded over batches of 10000 samples show a typical RMS value of 35 ms.

We introduce the permission grid, a spatial occupancy grid which can be used to guide almost any standard polygonal surface simplification algorithm into generating an approximation with a guaranteed geometric error bound. In particular, all points on the approximation are guaranteed to be within some user-specified distance from the original surface. Such bounds are notably absent from many current simplification methods, and are becoming increasingly important for applications in scientific computing and adaptive level of detail control. Conceptually simple, the permission grid defines a volume in which the approximation must lie, and does not permit the underlying simplification algorithm to generate approximations outside the volume. The permission grid makes three important, practical improvements over current error-bounded simplification methods. First, it works on arbitrary triangular models, handling all manners of mesh degeneracies gracefully. Further, the error tolerance may be easily expanded as simplification proceeds, allowing the construction of an error-bounded level of detail hierarchy with vertex correspondences among all levels of detail. And finally, the permission grid has a representation complexity independent of the size of the input model, and a small running time overhead, making it more practical and efficient than current methods with similar guarantees", "1137": "On deciding stability of constrained homogeneous random walks and queueing systems.

We also prove that stability of a homogeneous random walk in L/sub +//sup d/ is undecidable. Finally, we show that the problem of computing a fluid limit of a queueing system or of a constrained homogeneous random walk is undecidable. To the best of our knowledge these are the first undecidability results in the area of stability of queueing systems and random walks in L/sub +//sup d/.

In this paper, various methods for the real-time estimation of multi-modal frequencies are realized in real time and compared through numerical and experimental tests. These parameter-based frequency estimation methods can be applied to various engineering fields such as communications, radar and adaptive vibration and noise control. Well-known frequency estimation methods are introduced and explained. The Bairstow method is introduced to find the roots of a characteristic equation for estimations of multi-modal frequencies, and the computational efficiency of the Bairstow method is shown quantitatively. For a simple numerical test, we consider two sinusoids of the same amplitudes mixed with various amounts of white noise. The test results show that the auto regressive (AR) and auto regressive and moving average (ARMA) methods are unsuitable in noisy environments. The other methods apart from the AR method have fast tracking capability. From the point of view of computational efficiency, the results reveal that the ARMA method is inefficient, while the cascade notch filter method is very effective. The linearized adaptive notch filter and recursive maximum likelihood methods have average performances. Experimental tests are devised to confirm the feasibility of real-time computations and to impose the severe conditions of drastically different amplitudes and of considerable changes of natural frequencies. We have performed experiments to extract the natural frequencies from the vibration signal of wing-like composite plates in real time. The natural frequencies of the specimen are changed by added masses. Especially, the AR method exhibits a remarkable performance in spite of the severe conditions.

We proposed a novel method to realize the readout of super-resolution pits by using a super-resolution reflective film to replace the reflective layer of the conventional ROM. At the same time, by using Sb as the super-resolution reflective layer and SiN as a dielectric layer, the super-resolution pits with diameters of 380 nm were read out by a setup whose laser wavelength is 632.8 nm and numerical aperture is 0.40. In addition, the influence of the Sb thin film thickness on the readout signal was investigated, the results showed that the optimum Sb thin film thickness is 28 to 30 nm, and the maximum CNR is 38 to 40 dB", "1301": "Integrate-and-fire neurons driven by correlated stochastic input. Neurons are sensitive to correlations among synaptic inputs. However, analytical models that explicitly include correlations are hard to solve analytically, so their influence on a neuron's response has been difficult to ascertain. To gain some intuition on this problem, we studied the firing times of two simple integrate-and-fire model neurons driven by a correlated binary variable that represents the total input current. Analytic expressions were obtained for the average firing rate and coefficient of variation (a measure of spike-train variability) as functions of the mean, variance, and correlation time of the stochastic input. The results of computer simulations were in excellent agreement with these expressions. In these models, an increase in correlation time in general produces an increase in both the average firing rate and the variability of the output spike trains. However, the magnitude of the changes depends differentially on the relative values of the input mean and variance: the increase in firing rate is higher when the variance is large relative to the mean, whereas the increase in variability is higher when the variance is relatively small. In addition, the firing rate always tends to a finite limit value as the correlation time increases toward infinity, whereas the coefficient of variation typically diverges. These results suggest that temporal correlations may play a major role in determining the variability as well as the intensity of neuronal spike trains", "719": "War games: The truth [network security].

We define a family of embedded domain specific languages for generating HTML and XML documents. Each language is implemented as a combinator library in Haskell. The generated HTML/XML documents are guaranteed to be well-formed. In addition, each library can guarantee that the generated documents are valid XML documents to a certain extent (for HTML only a weaker guarantee is possible). On top of the libraries, Haskell serves as a meta language to define parameterized documents, to map structured documents to HTML/XML, to define conditional content, or to define entire Web sites. The combinator libraries support element-transforming style, a programming style that allows programs to have a visual appearance similar to HTML/XML documents, without modifying the syntax of Haskell", "8": "New investors get steal of a deal [Global Crossing].

In this paper we are concerned with the design, manufacture and performance test of a lightweight piezo-composite curved actuator (called LIPCA) using a top carbon fiber composite layer with near-zero coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), a middle PZT ceramic wafer, and a bottom glass/epoxy layer with a high CTE. The main point of the design for LIPCA is to replace the heavy metal layers of THUNDER TM by lightweight fiber reinforced plastic layers without losing the capabilities for generating high force and large displacement. It is possible to save up to about 40% of the weight if we replace the metallic backing material by the light fiber composite layer. We can also have design flexibility by selecting the fiber direction and the size of prepreg layers. In addition to the lightweight advantage and design flexibility, the proposed device can be manufactured without adhesive layers when we use an epoxy resin prepreg system. Glass/epoxy prepregs, a ceramic wafer with electrode surfaces, and a carbon prepreg were simply stacked and cured at an elevated temperature (177 degrees C) after following an autoclave bagging process. We found that the manufactured composite laminate device had a sufficient curvature after being detached from a flat mould. An analysis method using the classical lamination theory is presented to predict the curvature of LIPCA after curing at an elevated temperature. The predicted curvatures are in quite good agreement with the experimental values. In order to investigate the merits of LIPCA, performance tests of both LIPCA and THUNDER TM have been conducted under the same boundary conditions. From the experimental actuation tests, it was observed that the developed actuator could generate larger actuation displacement than THUNDER TM", "1162": "Recognition of finite simple groups S/sub 4/(q) by their element orders.

In order to guarantee the safe delivery of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), verification of the leaf trajectories during the treatment is necessary. Our aim in this study is to develop a method for on-line verification of leaf trajectories using an electronic portal imaging device with scanning read-out, independent of the multileaf collimator. Examples of such scanning imagers are electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) based on liquid-filled ionization chambers and those based on amorphous silicon. Portal images were acquired continuously with a liquid-filled ionization chamber EPID during the delivery, together with the signal of treatment progress that is generated by the accelerator. For each portal image, the prescribed leaf and diaphragm positions were computed from the dynamic prescription and the progress information. Motion distortion effects of the leaves are corrected based on the treatment progress that is recorded for each image row. The aperture formed by the prescribed leaves and diaphragms is used as the reference field edge, while the actual field edge is found using a maximum-gradient edge detector. The errors in leaf and diaphragm position are found from the deviations between the reference field edge and the detected field edge. Earlier measurements of the dynamic EPID response show that the accuracy of the detected field edge is better than 1 mm. To ensure that the verification is independent of inaccuracies in the acquired progress signal, the signal was checked with diode measurements beforehand. The method was tested on three different dynamic prescriptions. Using the described method, we correctly reproduced the distorted field edges. Verifying a single portal image took 0.1 s on an 866 MHz personal computer. Two flaws in the control system of our experimental dynamic multileaf collimator were correctly revealed with our method. First, the errors in leaf position increase with leaf speed, indicating a delay of approximately 0.8 s in the control system. Second, the accuracy of the leaves and diaphragms depends on the direction of motion. In conclusion, the described verification method is suitable for detailed verification of leaf trajectories during dynamic IMRT", "1066": "Application of artificial intelligence to search ground-state geometry of clusters. We introduce a global optimization procedure, the neural-assisted genetic algorithm (NAGA). It combines the power of an artificial neural network (ANN) with the versatility of the genetic algorithm. This method is suitable to solve optimization problems that depend on some kind of heuristics to limit the search space. If a reasonable amount of data is available, the ANN can \"understand\" the problem and provide the genetic algorithm with a selected population of elements that will speed up the search for the optimum solution. We tested the method in a search for the ground-state geometry of silicon clusters. We trained the ANN with information about the geometry and energetics of small silicon clusters. Next, the ANN learned how to restrict the configurational space for larger silicon clusters. For Si/sub 10/ and Si/sub 20/, we noticed that the NAGA is at least three times faster than the \"pure\" genetic algorithm. As the size of the cluster increases, it is expected that the gain in terms of time will increase as well", "820": "Yet some more complexity results for default logic.

This paper presents a knowledge e-based approach dedicated to the efficient management, regulation, interactive and dynamic monitoring of urban infrastructures. This approach identifies the data and related treatments common to several municipal activities and defines the requirements and functionalities of the computer tools developed to improve the delivery and coordination of municipal services to the population. The resulting cooperative system called SIGIU is composed of a set of integrated operating systems (SYDEX) and the global planning and coordination system (SYGEC). The objective is to integrate the set of SYDEX and the SYGEC into a single coherent system for all the SIGIU's users according to their tasks, their roles, and their responsibilities within the municipal administration. SIGIU is provided by different measurement and monitoring instruments installed on some system's elements to be supervised. In this context, the information can be presented in different forms: video, pictures, data and alarms. One of SIGIU's objectives is the real-time management of urban infrastructures' control mechanisms.

For quantitative image reconstruction in positron emission tomography attenuation correction is mandatory. In case that no data are available for the calculation of the attenuation correction factors one can try to determine them from the emission data alone. However, it is not clear if the information content is sufficient to yield an adequate attenuation correction together with a satisfactory activity distribution. Therefore, we determined the log likelihood distribution for a thorax phantom depending on the choice of attenuation and activity pixel values to measure the crosstalk between both. In addition an iterative image reconstruction (one-dimensional Newton-type algorithm with a maximum likelihood estimator), which simultaneously reconstructs the images of the activity distribution and the attenuation coefficients is used to demonstrate the problems and possibilities of such a reconstruction. As result we show that for a change of the log likelihood in the range of statistical noise, the associated change in the activity value of a structure is between 6% and 263%. In addition, we show that it is not possible to choose the best maximum on the basis of the log likelihood when a regularization is used, because the coupling between different structures mediated by the (smoothing) regularization prevents an adequate solution due to crosstalk. We conclude that taking into account the attenuation information in the emission data improves the performance of image reconstruction with respect to the bias of the activities, however, the reconstruction still is not quantitative", "790": "Data assimilation of local model error forecasts in a deterministic model. One of the most popular data assimilation techniques in use today are of the Kalman filter type, which provide an improved estimate of the state of a system up to the current time level, based on actual measurements. From a forecasting viewpoint, this corresponds to an updating of the initial conditions. The standard forecasting procedure is to then run the model uncorrected into the future, driven by predicted boundary and forcing conditions. The problem with this methodology is that the updated initial conditions quickly 'wash-out', thus, after a certain forecast horizon the model predictions are no better than from an initially uncorrected model. This study demonstrates that through the assimilation of error forecasts (in the present case made using so-called local models) entire model domains can be corrected for extended forecast horizons (i.e. long after updated initial conditions have become washed-out), thus demonstrating significant improvements over the conventional methodology. Some alternate uses of local models are also explored for the re-distribution of error forecasts over the entire model domain, which are then compared with more conventional Kalman filter type schemes", "701": "High dynamic control of a three-level voltage-source-converter drive for a main strip mill.

Succession in standardization is often a problem. The advantages of improvements must be weighed against those of compatibility. If compatibility considerations dominate, a grafting process takes place. According to our taxonomy of succession, there are three types of outcomes. A Type I succession, where grafting is successful, entails compatibility between successors, technical paradigm compliance and continuity in the standards trajectory. In this paper, we examine issues of succession and focus on the Extensible Markup Language (XML). It was to be grafted on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a stable standard since 1988. However, XML was a profile, a subset and an extension of SGML (1988). Adaptation of SGML was needed (SGML 1999) to forge full (downward) compatibility with XML (1998). We describe the grafting efforts and analyze their outcomes. Our conclusion is that although SGML was a technical exemplar for XML developers, full compatibility was not achieved. The widespread use of HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) exemplified the desirability of simplicity in XML, standardization. This and HTML's user market largely explain the discontinuity in SGML-XML succession", "124": "High-speed CMOS circuits with parallel dynamic logic and speed-enhanced skewed static logic. In this paper, we describe parallel dynamic logic (PDL) which exhibits high speed without charge sharing problem.

It has less back-bias effect compared to other logic styles, which use stacked transistors. Furthermore, PDL needs no signal ordering or tapering. PDL with speed-enhanced skewed static logic renders straightforward logic synthesis without the usual area penalty due to logic duplication. Our experimental results on two 32-bit carry lookahead adders using 0.25- mu m CMOS technology show that PDL with speed-enhanced skewed static (SSS) look reduces the delay over clock-delayed(CD)-domino by 15%-27% and the power-delay product by 20%-37%", "131": "On biorthogonal nonuniform filter banks and tree structures.

We then show that a stronger statement can be made about dyadic filter banks in general: That a dyadic filter bank is biorthogonal if both the analysis and synthesis banks can be decomposed into dyadic trees. We further show that these decompositions are stability and FIR preserving. These results, derived for filter banks having filters with rational transfer functions, thus extend some of the earlier comparable results for orthonormal filter banks", "1121": "Optimal bandwidth utilization of all-optical ring with a converter of degree 4. In many models of all-optical routing, a set of communication paths in a network is given, and a wavelength is to be assigned to each path so that paths sharing an edge receive different wavelengths. The goal is to assign as few wavelengths as possible, in order to use the optical bandwidth efficiently. If a node of a network contains a wavelength converter, any path that passes through this node may change its wavelength. Having converters at some of the nodes can reduce the number of wavelengths required for routing. This paper presents a wavelength converter with degree 4 and gives a routing algorithm which shows that any routing with load L can be realized with L wavelengths when a node of an all-optical ring hosts such a wavelength converter. It is also proved that 4 is the minimum degree of the converter to reach the full utilization of the available wavelengths if only one node of an all-optical ring hosts a converter", "1068": "Quantum phase gate for photonic qubits using only beam splitters and postselection.

With the development of the Internet, the World Wide Web has become an invaluable information source for most organizations.

Effectively extracting data from such documents remains a nontrivial task. In this paper, we present a schema-guided approach to extracting data from HTML pages. Under the approach, the user defines a schema specifying what to be extracted and provides sample mappings between the schema and the HTML page. The system will induce the mapping rules and generate a wrapper that takes the HTML page as input and produces the required data in the form of XML conforming to the user-defined schema.

A general algorithm for robustly reducing the nonlinear PDE model is presented and, based on an investigation of five state-of-the-art model-order reduction techniques, we are able to reduce the original model to a model with only 30 states without incurring pronounced modelling errors.

In vibration control of a structure by using an active tuned mass damper (ATMD), stroke of the auxiliary mass is so limited that it is difficult to control the vibration in the case of large disturbance input. In this paper, two methods are proposed for the problem. One of the methods is a switching control system by two types of controllers. One of the controllers is a normal controller under small relative displacement of the auxiliary mass, and the other is not effective only for first mode of vibration under large relative displacement of the auxiliary mass. New variable gain control system is constructed by switching these two controllers. The other method is the brake system. In active vibration control, it is necessary to use actuator for active control. By using the actuator, the proposed system puts on the brake to suppress displacement increase of the auxiliary mass under large disturbance input. Finally, the systems are designed and the effectiveness of the systems is confirmed by the simulation", "931": "Active vibration control of composite sandwich beams with piezoelectric extension-bending and shear actuators. We have used quasi-static equations of piezoelectricity to derive a finite element formulation capable of modelling two different kinds of piezoelastically induced actuation in an adaptive composite sandwich beam. This formulation is made to couple certain piezoelectric constants to a transverse electric field to develop extension-bending actuation and shear-induced actuation. As an illustration, we present a sandwich model of three sublaminates: face/core/face. We develop a control scheme based on the linear quadratic regulator/independent modal space control (LQR/IMSC) method and use this to estimate the active stiffness and the active damping introduced by shear and extension-bending actuators. To assess the performance of each type of actuator, a dynamic response study is carried out in the modal domain. We observe that the shear actuator is more efficient in actively controlling the vibration than the extension-bending actuator for the same control effort", "1441": "Handles and exception safety, Part 1. A simple handle class. Every C++ program that uses inheritance must manage memory somehow. The most obvious way to do so is directly, but programmers who create complicated data structures often have trouble figuring out what parts of those data structures are safe to delete when. The classical method of dealing with such complexity is to hide it in a class. Such classes are typically called handles; the idea is to attach a handle object to another object that contains the actual data. The simplest form of a handle, which we have discussed in this article, is one in which each handle object corresponds to a single object from the inheritance hierarchy. Such handles are straightforward to use and to implement and tend to be intrinsically exception safe in almost all respects. The one exception hazard in such a class is typically the assignment operator. Assignment operators often test for self-assignment to avoid aliasing problems. As Herb Sutter has observed (2000), programs that need such tests are almost always exception unsafe. By rewriting the assignment operator, we ensure that we do not do anything irrevocable until the possibility of throwing an exception has passed. This strategy ensures that if an exception occurs while our assignment operator is executing, we do not corrupt the rest of our system", "1101": "Evaluation of existing and new feature recognition algorithms. 1.

The two main parts of this system are: (1) iterative tool design based on thermal and structural models; and (2) fabrication of the tool using a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software and abrasive water jet cutting. CAM software has been developed to take lamination slice data (profiles) from any proprietary RP software in the form of polylines and create smooth, kinematically desirable cutting trajectories for each tool lamination. Two cutting trajectory algorithms, called identical equidistant profile segmentation and adaptively vector profiles projection (AVPP), were created for this purpose.

This paper is focused on variable-speed drives and it is shown that with the proposed multilevel direct torque control strategy (DiCoIF) the tradeoff between the performances of the drive (harmonic distortions, torque dynamics, voltage step gradients, etc.) and the switching frequency of the semiconductors is improved. Then, a slightly modified strategy reducing common-mode voltage and bearing currents is presented", "1085": "A variable-stepsize variable-order multistep method for the integration of perturbed linear problems. G. Scheifele (1971) wrote the solution of a perturbed oscillator as an expansion in terms of a new set of functions, which extends the monomials in the Taylor series of the solution. Recently, P. Martin and J.M. Ferrandiz (1997) constructed a multistep code based on the Scheifele technique, and it was generalized by D.J. Lopez and P. Martin (1998) for perturbed linear problems. However, the remarked codes are constant steplength methods, and efficient integrators must be able to change the steplength. In this paper we extend the ideas of F.T. Krogh (1974) from Adams methods to the algorithm proposed by Lopez and Martin, and we show the advantages of the new code in perturbed problems", "863": "A scanline-based algorithm for the 2D free-form bin packing problem. This paper describes a heuristic algorithm for the 2D free-form bin packing (2D-FBP) problem. Given a set of 2D free-form bins and a set of 2D free-form items, the 2D-FBP problem is to lay out items inside one or more bins in such a way that the number of bins used is minimized, and for each bin, the yield is maximized. The proposed algorithm handles the problem as a variant of the 1D problem; i.e., items and bins are approximated as sets of scanlines, and scanlines are packed. The details of the algorithm are given, and its application to a nesting problem in a shipbuilding company is reported. The proposed algorithm consists of the basic and the group placement algorithms. The basic placement algorithm is a variant of the first-fit decreasing algorithm which is simply extended from the 1D case to the 2D case by a novel scanline approximation. A numerical study with real instances shows that the basic placement algorithm has sufficient performance for most of the instances, however, the group placement algorithm is required when items must be aligned in columns. The qualities of the resulting layouts are good enough for practical use, and the processing times are good", "1285": "On fractal dimension in information systems. Toward exact sets in infinite information systems. The notions of an exact as well as a rough set are well-grounded as basic notions in rough set theory. They are however defined in the setting of a finite information system i.e. an information system having finite numbers of objects as well as attributes. In theoretical studies e.g. of topological properties of rough sets, one has to trespass this limitation and to consider information systems with potentially unbound number of attributes. In such setting, the notions of rough and exact sets may be defined in terms of topological operators of interior and closure with respect to an appropriate topology following the ideas from the finite case, where it is noticed that in the finite case rough-set-theoretic operators of lower and upper approximation are identical with the interior, respectively, closure operators in topology induced by equivalence classes of the indiscernibility relation. Extensions of finite information systems are also desirable from application point of view in the area of knowledge discovery and data mining, when demands of e.g. mass collaboration and/or huge experimental data call for need of working with large data tables so the sound theoretical generalization of these cases is an information system with the number of attributes not bound in advance by a fixed integer i.e. an information system with countably but infinitely many attributes, In large information systems, a need arises for qualitative measures of complexity of concepts involved free of parameters, cf. e.g. applications for the Vapnik-Czervonenkis dimension. We study here in the theoretical setting of infinite information system a proposal to apply fractal dimensions suitably modified as measures of concept complexity", "610": "AGC for autonomous power system using combined intelligent techniques. In the present work two intelligent load frequency controllers have been developed to regulate the power output and system frequency by controlling the speed of the generator with the help of fuel rack position control. The first controller is obtained using fuzzy logic (FL) only, whereas the second one by using a combination of FL, genetic algorithms and neural networks. The aim of the proposed controller(s) is to restore in a very smooth way the frequency to its nominal value in the shortest time possible whenever there is any change in the load demand etc. The action of these controller(s) provides a satisfactory balance between frequency overshoot and transient oscillations with zero steady-state error. The design and performance evaluation of the proposed controller(s) structure are illustrated with the help of case studies applied (without loss of generality) to a typical single-area power system. It is found that the proposed controllers exhibit satisfactory overall dynamic performance and overcome the possible drawbacks associated with other competing techniques", "628": "Rank tests of association for exchangeable paired data. We describe two rank tests of association for paired exchangeable data motivated by the study of lifespans in twins. The pooled sample is ranked. The nonparametric test of association is based on R/sup +/, the sum of the smaller within-pair ranks. A second measure L/sup +/ is the sum of within-pair rank products. Under the null hypothesis of within-pair independence, the two test statistics are approximately normally distributed. Expressions for the exact means and variances of R/sup +/ and L/sup +/ are given. We describe the power of these two statistics under a close alternative hypothesis to that of independence. Both the R/sup +/ and L/sup +/ tests indicate nonparametric statistical evidence of positive association of longevity in identical twins and a negligible relationship between the lifespans of fraternal twins listed in the Danish twin registry.

Batch servicing is a common way of benefiting from economies of scale in manufacturing operations. Good examples of production systems that allow for batch processing are ovens found in the aircraft industry and in semiconductor manufacturing. In this paper we study the issue of dynamic scheduling of such systems within the context of multi-stage flow shops. So far, a great deal of research has concentrated on the development of control strategies, which only address the batch stage. This paper proposes an integral scheduling approach that also includes succeeding stages. In this way, we aim for shop optimization, instead of optimizing performance for a single stage. Our so-called look-ahead strategy adapts its scheduling decision to shop status, which includes information on a limited number of near-future arrivals. In particular, we study a two-stage flow shop, in which the batch stage is succeeded by a serial stage. The serial stage may be realized by a single machine or by parallel machines. Through an extensive simulation study it is demonstrated how shop performance can be improved by the proposed strategy relative to existing strategies", "1371": "Design methodology for diagnostic strategies for industrial systems.

The method allows one to consider multiple simultaneous failures and is specifically designed to make easier the coordination and simplification of local diagnostic algorithms developed by different teams", "973": "Time-integration of multiphase chemistry in size-resolved cloud models. The existence of cloud drops leads to a transfer of chemical species between the gas and aqueous phases. Species concentrations in both phases are modified by chemical reactions and by this phase transfer. The model equations resulting from such multiphase chemical systems are nonlinear, highly coupled and extremely stiff. In the paper we investigate several numerical approaches for treating such processes. The droplets are subdivided into several classes. This decomposition of the droplet spectrum into classes is based on their droplet size and the amount of scavenged material inside the drops, respectively. The very fast dissociations in the aqueous phase chemistry are treated as forward and backward reactions. The aqueous phase and gas phase chemistry, the mass transfer between the different droplet classes among themselves and with the gas phase are integrated in an implicit and coupled manner by the second order BDF method. For this part we apply a modification of the code LSODE with special linear system solvers. These direct sparse techniques exploit the special block structure of the corresponding Jacobian. Furthermore we investigate an approximate matrix factorization which is related to operator splitting at the linear algebra level. The sparse Jacobians are generated explicitly and stored in a sparse form. The efficiency and accuracy of our time-integration schemes is discussed for four multiphase chemistry systems of different complexity and for a different number of droplet classes", "145": "If the RedBoot fits [open-source ROM monitor]. Many embedded developers today use a ROM- or flash-resident software program that provides functionality such as loading and running application software, scripting, read/write access to processor registers, and memory dumps. A ROM monitor, as it is often called, can be a useful and far less expensive debugging tool than an in-circuit emulator. This article describes the RedBoot ROM monitor. It takes a look at the features offered by the RedBoot ROM monitor and sees how it can be configured. It also walks through the steps of rebuilding and installing a new RedBoot image on a target platform. Finally, it looks at future enhancements that are coming in new releases and how to get support and additional information when using RedBoot. Although RedBoot uses software modules from the eCos real-time operating system (RTOS) and is often used in systems running embedded Linux, it is completely independent of both operating systems.

The Internet is spreading into our society rapidly and is becoming one of the information infrastructures that are indispensable for our daily life. In particular, the WWW is widely used for various purposes such as sharing personal information, academic research, business work, and electronic commerce, and the amount of available information is increasing rapidly. We usually utilize information sources on the Internet as individual stand-alone sources, but if we can integrate them, we can add more value to each of them. Hence, information mediators, which integrate information distributed on the Internet, are drawing attention. In this paper, under the assumption that the information sources to be integrated are updated frequently and asynchronously, we propose an information gathering method that constructs an answer to a query from a user, accessing information sources to be integrated properly within an allowable time period. The proposed method considers the reliability of data in the cache and the quality of answer in order to efficiently access information sources and to provide appropriate answers to the user. As evaluation, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method by using an artificial information integration problem, in which some parameters can be modified, and a real-world flight information service compared with a conventional FIFO information gathering method", "1435": "Experimental investigations on monitoring and control of induction heating process for semi-solid alloys using the heating coil as sensor. A method of monitoring the state of metal alloys during induction heating and control of the heating process utilizing the heating coil itself as a sensor is proposed, and its usefulness and effectiveness were experimentally investigated using aluminium A357 billets for the semi-solid metal (SSM) casting processes. The impedance of the coil containing the billet was continuously measured by the proposed method in the temperature range between room temperature and 700 degrees C. It was found that the reactance component of the impedance varied distinctively according to the billet state and could clearly monitor the deformation of the billet, while the resistance component increased with temperature, reflecting the variation of the resistivity of the billet which has strong correlation to the solid/liquid fraction of the billets. The measured impedance is very sensitive to the billet states such as temperature, deformation and solid/liquid fraction and could be used as a parameter to monitor and control the heating process for SSMs", "852": "Building an effective computer science student organization: the Carnegie Mellon Women@SCS action plan.

We describe two schemes for scheduling an integrated flight and propulsion control system for an experimental vertical/short take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft concept in the acceleration from hover (0-120 kn) flight phase. Multivariable integrated flight and propulsion controllers are designed at several points over the V/STOL envelope and implemented as exact plant observers with state feedback. In the first scheduling scheme, the values of the state feedback and observer gain matrices are interpolated between the fixed-point designs as a function of aircraft speed. In the second approach, the control signals produced by the different fixed-point controllers are blended, allowing a significant reduction in the order of the scheduled controllers. Both scheduling schemes are shown in nonlinear simulation to provide excellent handling qualities as the aircraft accelerates from the hover", "946": "Entanglement measures with asymptotic weak-monotonicity as lower (upper) bound for the entanglement of cost (distillation).

Transport theory describes the scattering behavior of physical particles such as photons. Here we show how to connect this theory to optimal control theory and to adaptive behavior of agents embedded in an environment. Environments and tasks are defined by physical boundary conditions. Given some task, we compute a set of probability densities on continuous state and action and time. From these densities we derive an optimal policy such that for all states the most likely action maximizes the probability of reaching a predefined goal state. Liouville's conservation theorem tells us that the conditional density at time t, state s, and action a must equal the density at t + dt, s + ds, a + da. Discretization yields a linear system that can be solved directly and whose solution corresponds to an optimal policy. Discounted reward schemes are incorporated naturally by taking the Laplace transform of the equations.

He considers how the importance of continuity has come under attack from Eliasmith (2001) who claims: (i) continuous nature of neurons is not relevant to the information they process, and (ii) continuity is not important for understanding cognition because the various sources of noise introduce uncertainty into spike arrival times, so encoding and decoding spike trains must be discrete at some level", "1181": "Dynamic neighborhood structures in parallel evolution strategies.

Pull-in parameters are important properties of electrostatic actuators. Efficient and accurate analysis tools that can capture these parameters for different design geometries, are therefore essential. Current simulation tools approach the pull-in state by iteratively adjusting the voltage applied across the actuator electrodes. The convergence rate of this scheme gradually deteriorates as the pull-in state is approached. Moreover, the convergence is inconsistent and requires many mesh and accuracy refinements to assure reliable predictions. As a result, the design procedure of electrostatically actuated MEMS devices can be time-consuming. In this paper a novel Displacement Iteration Pull-In Extraction (DIPIE) scheme is presented. The DIPIE scheme is shown to converge consistently and far more rapidly than the Voltage Iterations (VI) scheme (>100 times faster!). The DIPIE scheme requires separate mechanical and electrostatic field solvers. Therefore, it can be easily implemented in existing MOEMS CAD packages. Moreover, using the DIPIE scheme, the pull-in parameters extraction can be performed in a fully automated mode, and no user input for search bounds is required", "750": "Automated cerebrum segmentation from three-dimensional sagittal brain MR images. We present a fully automated cerebrum segmentation algorithm for full three-dimensional sagittal brain MR images. First, cerebrum segmentation from a midsagittal brain MR image is performed utilizing landmarks, anatomical information, and a connectivity-based threshold segmentation algorithm as previously reported. Recognizing that the cerebrum in laterally adjacent slices tends to have similar size and shape, we use the cerebrum segmentation result from the midsagittal brain MR image as a mask to guide cerebrum segmentation in adjacent lateral slices in an iterative fashion. This masking operation yields a masked image (preliminary cerebrum segmentation) for the next lateral slice, which may truncate brain region(s). Truncated regions are restored by first finding end points of their boundaries, by comparing the mask image and masked image boundaries, and then applying a connectivity-based algorithm. The resulting final extracted cerebrum image for this slice is then used as a mask for the next lateral slice. The algorithm yielded satisfactory fully automated cerebrum segmentations in three-dimensional sagittal brain MR images, and had performance superior to conventional edge detection algorithms for segmentation of cerebrum from 3D sagittal brain MR images", "1168": "Computing failure probabilities.

We present a slightly lossy compression algorithm that uses the noise statistics of the data to preserve information content while maximizing compression ratios. The adaptive principal components analysis (APCA) algorithm uses noise statistics to determine the number of significant principal components and selects only those that are required to represent each pixel to within the noise level.

Accurate determination of the head scatter factor S/sub c/ is an important issue, especially for intensity modulated radiation therapy, where the segmented fields are often very irregular and much less than the collimator jaw settings. In this work, we report an S/sub c/ calculation algorithm for symmetric, asymmetric, and irregular open fields shaped by the tertiary collimator (a multileaf collimator or blocks) at different source-to-chamber distance. The algorithm was based on a three-source model, in which the photon radiation to the point of calculation was treated as if it originated from three effective sources: one source for the primary photons from the target and two extra-focal photon sources for the scattered photons from the primary collimator and the flattening filter, respectively. The field mapping method proposed by Kim et al. [Phys. Med. Biol. 43, 1593-1604 (1998)] was extended to two extra-focal source planes and the scatter contributions were integrated over the projected areas (determined by the detector's eye view) in the three source planes considering the source intensity distributions. The algorithm was implemented using Microsoft Visual C/C++ in the MS Windows environment. The only input data required were head scatter factors for symmetric square fields, which are normally acquired during machine commissioning. A large number of different fields were used to evaluate the algorithm and the results were compared with measurements. We found that most of the calculated S/sub c/'s agreed with the measured values to within 0.4%. The algorithm can also be easily applied to deal with irregular fields shaped by a multileaf collimator that replaces the upper or lower collimator jaws", "120": "Self-organized critical traffic in parallel computer networks.

In this paper, we further extend our analysis by considering a generalization of the previous model in which the rate of packet emission is regulated by the local congestion perceived by each node. As a result of the feedback between traffic congestion and packet release, the system is poised at criticality.

Vibratory bowl feeders (VBFs) are machines that feed various small parts in large volume automatic assembly systems.

Applications of passive and active air jet based orienting devices that replace conventional devices for the VBF are discussed. Passive devices, which reject incorrectly oriented parts, are discussed first. Active air jet based orienting devices are then introduced to further improve the flexibility of VBFs.

For nonlinear time-invariant input-output dynamical systems the passivity conditions are obtained under some restrictions. The conditions imply storage functions satisfying a dissipation inequality.

An important, for practical application, class of the linear relaxation systems without direct input-output interaction is considered. A necessary condition for dynamical systems to be of the relaxation type is obtained for this class. The condition is connected with the existence of a unique quadratic Lyapunov function satisfying the complete monotonicity condition. This unique Lyapunov function corresponds to a \"standard\" thermodynamic potential in a compact family of potentials in the nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

In a typical probability learning task participants are presented with a repeated choice between two response alternatives, one of which has a higher payoff probability than the other. Rational choice theory requires that participants should eventually allocate all their responses to the high-payoff alternative, but previous research has found that people fail to maximize their payoffs. Instead, it is commonly observed that people match their response probabilities to the payoff probabilities. We report three experiments on this choice anomaly using a simple probability learning task in which participants were provided with (i) large financial incentives, (ii) meaningful and regular feedback, and (iii) extensive training. In each experiment large proportions of participants adopted the optimal response strategy and all three of the factors mentioned above contributed to this.

Interval estimation of the gamma % effective dose ( mu /sub gamma / say) is often based on the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator (delta interval) or Fieller's theorem (Fieller interval). Sitter and Wu (1993) compared the delta and Fieller intervals for the median effective dose ( mu /sub 50/) assuming a logistic dose-response curve. Their results indicated that although Fieller intervals are generally superior to delta intervals, they appear to be conservative. Here an adjusted form of the Fieller interval for mu /sub gamma / termed an adjusted Fieller (AF) interval is introduced. A comparison of the AF interval with the delta and Fieller intervals is provided and the properties of these three interval estimation methods are investigated", "1277": "Dynamic modification of object Petri nets. An application to modelling protocols with fork-join structures. In this paper we discuss possibilities of modelling protocols by objects in object-based high-level Petri nets.

In this paper, the problem of estimating the intrinsic dimension of a data set is investigated. A fractal-based approach using the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm is proposed.

Database broadcast is an effective and scalable approach to disseminate information of high affinity to a large collection of mobile clients. A common problem of existing broadcast approaches is the lack of knowledge for a client to determine if all data items satisfying its query could be obtained from the broadcast. We therefore propose a semantic-based broadcast approach. A semantic descriptor is attached to each broadcast unit, called a data chunk. This semantic descriptor allows a client to determine if a query can be answered entirely based on broadcast items and, if needed, identify the precise definition of the remaining items in the form of a \"supplementary\" query. Data chunks can be of static or dynamic sizes and organized hierarchically. Their boundary can be determined on-the-fly, adaptive to the nature of client queries. We investigate different ways of organizing the data chunks over a broadcast channel to improve access performance. We introduce the data affinity index metric, which more accurately reflects client-perceived performance. A simulation model is built to evaluate our semantic-based broadcast schemes", "584": "Hybrid fuzzy modeling of chemical processes. Fuzzy models have been proved to have the ability of modeling all plants without any priori information. However, the performance of conventional fuzzy models can be very poor in the case of insufficient training data due to their poor extrapolation capacity. In order to overcome this problem, a hybrid grey-box fuzzy modeling approach is proposed in this paper to combine expert experience, local linear models and historical data into a uniform framework. It consists of two layers. The expert fuzzy model constructed from linguistic information, the local linear model and the T-S type fuzzy model constructed from data are all put in the first layer. Layer 2 is a fuzzy decision module that is used to decide which model in the first layer should be employed to make the final prediction. The output of the second layer is the output of the hybrid fuzzy model. With the help of the linguistic information, the poor extrapolation capacity problem caused by sparse training data for conventional fuzzy models can be overcome. Simulation result for pH neutralization process demonstrates its modeling ability over the linear models, the expert fuzzy model and the conventional fuzzy model", "600": "Development of railway VR safety simulation system.

In this letter, a new sliding-mode-sensorless control algorithm is proposed for the field-oriented induction machine drive. In the proposed algorithm, the terms containing flux, speed, and rotor time constant, which are common in both current and flux equations, in the current model of the induction machine are estimated by a sliding function. The flux and speed estimation accuracy is guaranteed when the error between the actual current and observed current converges to zero. Hence, the fourth-order system is reduced to two second-order systems, and the speed estimation becomes very simple and robust to the parameter uncertainties. The new approach is verified by simulation and experimental results", "1154": "The effect of voxel size on the accuracy of dose-volume histograms of prostate /sup 125/I seed implants. Cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVH) are crucial in evaluating the quality of radioactive seed prostate implants. When calculating DVHs, the choice of voxel size is a compromise between computational speed (larger voxels) and accuracy (smaller voxels). We quantified the effect of voxel size on the accuracy of DVHs using an in-house computer program. The program was validated by comparison with a hand-calculated DVH for a single 0.4-U iodine-125 model 6711 seed. We used the program to find the voxel size required to obtain accurate DVHs of five iodine-125 prostate implant patients at our institution. One-millimeter cubes were sufficient to obtain DVHs that are accurate within 5% up to 200% of the prescription dose. For the five patient plans, we obtained good agreement with the VariSeed (version 6.7, Varian, USA) treatment planning software's DVH algorithm by using voxels with a sup-inf dimension equal to the spacing between successive transverse seed implant planes (5 mm). The volume that receives at least 200% of the target dose, V/sub 200/, calculated by VariSeed was 30% to 43% larger than that calculated by our program with small voxels. The single-seed DVH calculated by VariSeed fell below the hand calculation by up to 50% at low doses (30 Gy), and above it by over 50% at high doses (>250 Gy)", "658": "Process pioneers [agile business].

Combinatorial explosion which occurs in parallel compositions of LTSs can be alleviated by letting the stubborn set method construct on-the-fly a reduced LTS that is CFFD- or CSP-equivalent to the actual parallel composition. This article considers the problem of minimizing the number of successor states of a given state in the reduced LTS. The problem can be solved by constructing an and/or-graph with weighted vertices and by finding a set of vertices that satisfies a certain constraint such that no set of vertices satisfying the constraint has a smaller sum of weights. Without weights, the and/or-graph can be constructed in low-degree polynomial time w.r.t. the length of the input of the problem. However, since actions can be nondeterministic and transitions can share target states, it is not known whether the weights are generally computable in polynomial time. Consequently, it is an open problem whether minimizing the number of successor states is as \"easy\" as minimizing the number of successor transitions", "14": "Application of hybrid models for prediction and optimization of enzyme fermentation process.

A three-dimensional (3D) particle image tracking technique was used to study the coarse spherical particle-liquid flows in a pipe. The flow images from both the front view and the normal side view, which was reflected into the front view by a mirror, were recorded with a CCD camera and digitized by a PC with an image grabber card. An image processing program was developed to enhance and segment the flow image, and then to identify the particles. Over 90% of all the particles can be identified and located from the partially overlapped particle images using the circular Hough transform. Then the 3D position of each detected particle was determined by matching its front view image to its side view image. The particle velocity was then obtained by pairing its images in successive video fields. The measurements for the spherical expanded polystyrene particle-oil flows show that the particles, like the spherical bubbles in laminar bubbly flows, tend to conglomerate near the pipe wall and to line up to form the particle clusters. As liquid velocity decreases, the particle clusters disperse and more particles are distributed in the pipe centre region", "123": "A new identification approach for FIR models. The identification of stochastic discrete systems disturbed with noise is discussed in this brief. The concept of general prediction error (GPE) criterion is introduced for the time-domain estimate with optimal frequency estimation (OFE) introduced for the frequency-domain estimate. The two estimation methods are combined to form a new identification algorithm, which is called the empirical frequency-domain optimal parameter (EFOP) estimate, for the finite impulse response (FIR) model interfered by noise. The algorithm theoretically provides the global optimum of the model frequency-domain estimate.

As a corollary, we prove a uniform polynomial convergence rate of the value of the N-stage game to the value of the nondiscount game, over a bounded set of payoffs", "1265": "Optimization of requantization parameter for MPEG transcoding. This paper considers transcoding in which an MPEG stream is converted to a low-bit-rate MPEG stream, and proposes a method in which the transcoding error can be reduced by optimally selecting the quantization parameter for each macroblock. In transcoding with a low compression ratio, it is crucial to prohibit transcoding with a requantization parameter which is 1 to 2 times the quantization parameter of the input stream. Consequently, as the first step, an optimization method for the requantization parameter is proposed which cares for the error propagation effect by interframe prediction. Then, the proposed optimization method is extended so that the method can also be applied to the case of a high compression ratio in which the rate-distortion curve is approximated for each macroblock in the range of requantization parameters larger than 2 times the quantization parameter. It is verified by a simulation experiment that the PSNR is improved by 0.5 to 0.8 dB compared to the case in which a 6 Mbit/s MPEG stream is not optimized by twofold recompression", "61": "Application of time-frequency principal component analysis to text-independent speaker identification. We propose a formalism, called vector filtering of spectral trajectories, that allows the integration of a number of speech parameterization approaches (cepstral analysis, Delta and Delta Delta parameterizations, auto-regressive vector modeling, ...) under a common formalism. We then propose a new filtering, called contextual principal components (CPC) or time-frequency principal components (TFPC). This filtering consists in extracting the principal components of the contextual covariance matrix, which is the covariance matrix of a sequence of vectors expanded by their context. We apply this new filtering in the framework of closed-set speaker identification, using a subset of the POLYCOST database.

Taking advantage of the inherent efficiency of an algorithm for shortest paths enumeration and also of the characteristics of the reliability problem in which it will be used, an algorithm with lower complexity than the best algorithm in the literature for solving this problem, was obtained.

It need not be individual-to-individual. Rather, it can be subtly built into social practices and social institutions.

A center-crossing recurrent neural network is one in which the null(hyper)surfaces of each neuron intersect at their exact centers of symmetry, ensuring that each neuron's activation function is centered over the range of net inputs that it receives. We demonstrate that relative to a random initial population, seeding the initial population of an evolutionary search with center-crossing networks significantly improves both the frequency and the speed with which high-fitness oscillatory circuits evolve on a simple walking task. The improvement is especially striking at low mutation variances. Our results suggest that seeding with center-crossing networks may often be beneficial, since a wider range of dynamics is more likely to be easily accessible from a population of center-crossing networks than from a population of random networks", "899": "Mathematical model of functioning of an insurance company with allowance for advertising expenses.

Coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) are already widely utilized as measuring tools in the modem manufacturing industry. Rapidly approaching now is the trend for next-generation CMMs. However, the increases in measuring velocity of CMM applications are limited by dynamic errors that occur in CMMs. In this paper a systematic approach for modeling the dynamic errors of a touch-trigger probe CMM is developed through theoretical analysis and experimental study. An overall analysis of the dynamic errors of CMMs is conducted, with weak components of the CMM identified by a laser interferometer. The probing process, as conducted with a touch-trigger probe, is analyzed. The dynamic errors are measured, modeled, and predicted using neural networks. The results indicate that, using this mode, it is possible to compensate for the dynamic errors of CMMs", "894": "Improved detection of lung nodules by using a temporal subtraction technique. The authors evaluated the effect of a temporal subtraction technique for digital chest radiography with regard to the accuracy of detection of lung nodules. Twenty solitary lung nodules smaller than 30 mm in diameter, including 10 lung cancers and 10 benign nodules, were used. The nodules were grouped subjectively according to their subtlety. For nonnodular cases, 20 nodules without perceptible interval changes were selected. All chest radiographs were obtained by using a computed radiographic system, and temporal subtraction images were produced by using a program developed at the University of Chicago. The effect of the temporal subtraction image was evaluated by using an observer performance study, with use of receiver operating characteristic analysis. Observer performance with temporal subtraction images was substantially improved (A/sub z/ = 0.980 and 0.958), as compared with that without temporal subtraction images (A/sub z/ = 0.920 and 0.825) for the certified radiologists and radiology residents, respectively. The temporal subtraction technique clearly improved diagnostic accuracy for detecting lung nodules, especially subtle cases. In conclusion, the temporal subtraction technique is useful for improving detection accuracy for peripheral lung nodules on digital chest radiographs", "1074": "Inhibiting decoherence via ancilla processes.

Accurate diagnosis of tumor extent is important in three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. This study reports the use of image fusion between (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (/sup 18/FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (MRI/CT) for better targets delineation in radiotherapy planning of head-and-neck cancers. The subjects consisted of 12 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma and 9 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who were treated with radical radiotherapy between July 1999 and February 2001. Image fusion between /sup 18/FDG-PET and MRI/CT was performed using an automatic multimodality image registration algorithm, which used the brain as an internal reference for registration. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was determined based on clinical examination and /sup 18/FDG uptake on the fusion images. Clinical target volume (CTV) was determined following the usual pattern of lymph node spread for each disease entity along with the clinical presentation of each patient. Except for 3 cases with superficial tumors, all the other primary tumors were detected by /sup 18/FDG-PET. The GTV volumes for primary tumors were not changed by image fusion in 19 cases (89%), increased by 49% in one NPC, and decreased by 45% in another NPC. Normal tissue sparing was more easily performed based on clearer GTV and CTV determination on the fusion images. In particular, parotid sparing became possible in 15 patients (71%) whose upper neck areas near the parotid glands were tumor-free by /sup 18/FDG-PET. Within a mean follow-up period of 18 months, no recurrence occurred in the areas defined as CTV, which was treated prophylactically, except for 1 patient who experienced nodal recurrence in the CTV and simultaneous primary site recurrence. In conclusion, this preliminary study showed that image fusion between /sup 18/FDG-PET and MRI/CT was useful in GTV and CTV determination in conformal RT, thus sparing normal tissues", "1060": "Variety identification of wheat using mass spectrometry with neural networks and the influence of mass spectra processing prior to neural network analysis. The performance of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry with neural networks in wheat variety classification is further evaluated.

The number of wheat varieties tested was increased from 10 to 30. The main pre-processing method investigated was based on Gaussian smoothing of the spectra, but other methods based on normalisation procedures and multiplicative scatter correction of data were also used.

Traces the history of the provision of business information by Leeds Public Libraries, UK, from the opening of the Public Commercial and Technical Library in 1918 to the revolutionary impact of the Internet in the 1990s.

In this paper we show that this model is also effective for improving the quality of speech signals corrupted by additive noise. The computational requirements of the algorithm can be significantly reduced, essentially without paying performance penalties, by incorporating a dual codebook scheme with tied variances.

Minoux (1976) considered the maximum balanced flow problem, i.e. the problem of finding a maximum flow in a two-terminal network N = (V,A) with source s and sink t satisfying the constraint that any arc-flow of N is bounded by a fixed proportion of the total flow value from s to t, where V is vertex set and A is arc set. As a generalization, we focus on the problem of maximizing the total flow value of a generalized flow in N with gains gamma (a) > 0 (a in A) where any arc-flow is bounded by a fixed proportion of the total flow value, where gamma (a)f(a) units arrive at the vertex w for each arc-flow f(a) (a identical to ( upsilon , w) in A) entering vertex upsilon in a generalized flow. Our main results are to propose two polynomial algorithms for this problem. The first algorithm runs in O(mM(n, m, B') log B) time, where B is the maximum absolute value among integral values used by an instance of the problem, and M(n, m, B') denotes the complexity of solving a generalized maximum flow problem in a network with n vertices, and m arcs, and a rational instance expressed with integers between 1 and B'.

We introduce the dual differential game of a repeated game with lack of information on one side as the natural continuous time version of the dual game introduced by De Meyer (1996). A traditional way to study the value of differential games is through discrete time approximations. Here, we follow the opposite approach: We identify the limit value of a repeated game in discrete time as the value of a differential game. Namely, we use the recursive structure for the finitely repeated version of the dual game to construct a differential game for which the upper values of the uniform discretization satisfy precisely the same property. The value of the dual differential game exists and is the unique viscosity solution of a first-order derivative equation with a limit condition.

We describe an implementation of procedural solid texturing that uses the texture atlas, a one-to-one mapping from an object's surface into its texture space. The method uses the graphics hardware to rasterize the solid texture coordinates as colors directly into the atlas. A texturing procedure is applied per-pixel to the texture map, replacing each solid texture coordinate with its corresponding procedural solid texture result. The procedural solid texture is then mapped back onto the object surface using standard texture mapping. The implementation renders procedural solid textures in real time, and the user can design them interactively. The quality of this technique depends greatly on the layout of the texture atlas. A broad survey of texture atlas schemes is used to develop a set of general purpose mesh atlases and tools for measuring their effectiveness at distributing as many available texture samples as evenly across the surface as possible. The main contribution of this paper is a new multiresolution texture atlas. It distributes all available texture samples in a nearly uniform distribution.

In order to offer backward and forward secrecy for multicast applications (i.e., a new member cannot decrypt the multicast data sent before its joining and a former member cannot decrypt the data sent after its leaving), the data encryption key has to be changed whenever a user joins or leaves the system. Such a change has to be made known to all the current users. The bandwidth used for such re-key messaging can be high when the user pool is large. We propose a distributed servers approach to minimize the overall system bandwidth (and complexity) by splitting the user pool into multiple groups each served by a (logical) server. After presenting an analytic model for the system based on a hierarchical key tree, we show that there is an optimal number of servers to achieve minimum system bandwidth. As the underlying user traffic fluctuates, we propose a simple dynamic scheme with low overhead where a physical server adaptively splits and merges its traffic into multiple groups each served by a logical server so as to minimize its total bandwidth. Our results show that a distributed servers approach is able to substantially reduce the total bandwidth required as compared with the traditional single-server approach, especially for those applications with a large user pool, short holding time, and relatively low bandwidth of a data stream, as in the Internet stock quote applications", "1293": "Truss topology optimization by a modified genetic algorithm.

One of the most famous American physicists of the twentieth century, Richard Feynman, in 1982 was the first to propose using a quantum mechanical computing device to efficiently simulate quantum mechanical many-body dynamics, a task that is exponentially complex in the number of particles treated and is completely intractable by any classical computing means for large systems of many particles.

The optimal distribution of steady suction needed to control the growth of single or multiple disturbances in quasi-three-dimensional incompressible boundary layers on a flat plate is investigated. The evolution of disturbances is analysed in the framework of the parabolized stability equations (PSE). A gradient-based optimization procedure is used and the gradients are evaluated using the adjoint of the parabolized stability equations (APSE) and the adjoint of the boundary layer equations (ABLE). The accuracy of the gradient is increased by introducing a stabilization procedure for the PSE. Results show that a suction peak appears in the upstream part of the suction region for optimal control of Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves, steady streamwise streaks in a two-dimensional boundary layer and oblique waves in a quasi-three-dimensional boundary layer subject to an adverse pressure gradient. The mean flow modifications due to suction are shown to have a stabilizing effect similar to that of a favourable pressure gradient. It is also shown that the optimal suction distribution for the disturbance of interest reduces the growth rate of other perturbations. Results for control of a steady cross-flow mode in a three-dimensional boundary layer subject to a favourable pressure gradient show that not even large amounts of suction can completely stabilize the disturbance", "76": "Reaching strong consensus in a general network. The strong consensus (SC) problem is a variant of the conventional distributed consensus problem (also known as the Byzantine agreement problem). The SC problem requires that the agreed value among fault-free processors be one of the fault-free processor's initial values. Originally, the problem was studied in a fully connected network with malicious faulty processors. In this paper, the SC problem is re-examined in a general network, in which the components (processors and communication links) may be subjected to different faulty types simultaneously (also called the hybrid fault model or mixed faulty types) and the network topology does not have to be fully connected. The proposed protocol can tolerate the maximum number of tolerable faulty components such that each fault-free processor obtains a common value for the SC problem in a general network", "871": "Priming the pipeline [women in computer science careers].

This paper presents a set of extensions on High Performance Fortran (HPF) to make it more usable for parallelizing real-world production codes. HPF has been effective for programs that a compiler can automatically optimize efficiently. However, once the compiler cannot, there have been no ways for the users to explicitly parallelize or optimize their programs. In order to resolve the situation, we have developed a set of HPF extensions (HPF/JA) to give the users more control over sophisticated parallelization and communication optimizations. They include parallelization of loops with complicated reductions, asynchronous communication, user-controllable shadow, and communication pattern reuse for irregular remote data accesses. Preliminary experiments have proved that the extensions are effective at increasing HPF's usability", "732": "A unifying co-operative Web caching architecture. Network caching of objects has become a standard way of reducing network traffic and latency in the Web. However, Web caches exhibit poor performance with a hit rate of about 30%. A solution to improve this hit rate is to have a group of proxies form co-operation where objects can be cached for later retrieval. A cooperative cache system includes protocols for hierarchical and transversal caching. The drawback of such a system lies in the resulting network load due to the number of messages that need to be exchanged to locate an object. This paper proposes a new co-operative Web caching architecture, which unifies previous methods of Web caching. Performance results shows that the architecture achieve up to 70% co-operative hit rate and accesses the cached object in at most two hops. Moreover, the architecture is scalable with low traffic and database overhead", "624": "A hybrid ML-EM algorithm for calculation of maximum likelihood estimates in semiparametric shared frailty models. This paper describes a generalised hybrid ML-EM algorithm for the calculation of maximum likelihood estimates in semiparametric shared frailty models, the Cox proportional hazard models with hazard functions multiplied by a (parametric) frailty random variable. This hybrid method is much faster than the standard EM method and faster than the standard direct maximum likelihood method (ML, Newton-Raphson) for large samples. We have previously applied this method to semiparametric shared gamma frailty models, and verified by simulations the asymptotic and small sample statistical properties of the frailty variance estimates. Let theta /sub 0/ be the true value of the frailty variance parameter. Then the asymptotic distribution is normal for theta /sub 0/>0 while it is a 50-50 mixture between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis for theta /sub 0/=0. For small samples, simulations suggest that the frailty variance estimates are approximately distributed as an x-(100-x)% mixture, 0<or=x<or=50, between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis even for theta /sub 0/>0. We apply this method and verify by simulations these statistical results for semiparametric shared log-normal frailty models.

We present a polytime computable state equivalence that is defined with respect to a given CTL formula.

Additionally, we show that in some cases our techniques can detect if a formula passes or fails, without forming the entire product machine. The method is exact and fully automatic, and handles full CTL", "1077": "Quantum learning and universal quantum matching machine. Suppose that three kinds of quantum systems are given in some unknown states |f>/sup (X)N/, |g/sub 1/>/sup (X)K/, and |g/sub 2/>/sup (X)K/, and we want to decide which template state |g/sub 1/> or |g/sub 2/>, each representing the feature of the pattern class C/sub 1/ or C/sub 2/, respectively, is closest to the input feature state |f>. This is an extension of the pattern matching problem into the quantum domain. Assuming that these states are known a priori to belong to a certain parametric family of pure qubit systems, we derive two kinds of matching strategies. The first one is a semiclassical strategy that is obtained by the natural extension of conventional matching strategies and consists of a two-stage procedure: identification (estimation) of the unknown template states to design the classifier (learning process to train the classifier) and classification of the input system into the appropriate pattern class based on the estimated results. The other is a fully quantum strategy without any intermediate measurement, which we might call as the universal quantum matching machine. We present the Bayes optimal solutions for both strategies in the case of K=1, showing that there certainly exists a fully quantum matching procedure that is strictly superior to the straightforward semiclassical extension of the conventional matching strategy based on the learning process", "870": "Speaker identification from voice using neural networks. The paper provides three different schemes for speaker identification of personnel from their voice using artificial neural networks. The first scheme recognizes speakers by employing the classical backpropagation algorithm pre-trained with known voice samples of the persons. The second scheme provides a framework for classifying the known training samples of the voice features using a hierarchical architecture realized with a self-organizing feature map neural net. The first scheme is highly robust as it is capable of identifying the personnel from their noisy voice samples, but because of its excessive training time it has limited applications for a large voice database. The second scheme though not so robust as the former, however, can classify an unknown voice sample to its nearest class. The time needed for classification by the first scheme is always unique irrespective of the voice sample. It is proportional to the number of feedforward layers in the network. The time-requirement of the second classification scheme, however, is not free from the voice features and is proportional to the number of 2D arrays traversed by the algorithm on the hierarchical structure. The third scheme is highly robust and mis-classification is as low as 0.2 per cent. The third scheme combines the composite benefits of a radial basis function neural net and backpropagation trained neural net", "1287": "On average depth of decision trees implementing Boolean functions.

The performance of DSL systems is severely constrained by crosstalk due to the electromagnetic coupling among the multiple twisted pairs making up a phone cable. In order to reduce performance loss arising from crosstalk, DSL systems are currently designed under the assumption of worst-case crosstalk scenarios leading to overly conservative DSL deployments. This article presents a new paradigm for DSL system design, which takes into account the multi-user aspects of the DSL transmission environment. Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) departs from the current design philosophy by enabling transceivers to autonomously and dynamically optimize their communication settings with respect to both the channel and the transmissions of neighboring systems. Along with this distributed optimization, when an additional degree of coordination becomes available for future DSL deployment, DSM will allow even greater improvement in DSL performance. Implementations are readily applicable without causing any performance degradation to the existing DSLs under static spectrum management. After providing an overview of the DSM concept, this article reviews two practical DSM methods: iterative water-filling, an autonomous distributed power control method enabling great improvement in performance, which can be implemented through software options in some existing ADSL and VDSL systems; and vectored-DMT, a coordinated transmission/reception technique achieving crosstalk-free communication for DSL systems, which brings within reach the dream of providing universal Internet access at speeds close to 100 Mb/s to 500 m on 1-2 lines and beyond 1 km on 2-4 lines.

Emission tuned aperture computed tomography (ETACT) has been previously shown to have the potential for the detection of small tumors (<1 cm) in scintimammography. However, the optimal approach to the application of ETACT in the clinic has yet to be determined. Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of the angular disparity between the ETACT projections on image quality through the use of a computer simulation. A small, spherical tumor of variable size (5, 7.5 or 10 mm) was placed at the center of a hemispherical breast (15 cm diameter). The tumor to nontumor ratio was either 5:1 or 10:1. The detector was modeled to be a gamma camera fitted with a 4-mm-diam pinhole collimator. The pinhole-to-detector and the pinhole-to-tumor distances were 25 and 15 cm, respectively. A ray tracing technique was used to generate three sets of projections (10 degrees , 15 degrees , and 20 degrees , angular disparity). These data were blurred to a resolution consistent with the 4 mm pinhole. The TACT reconstruction method was used to reconstruct these three image sets. The tumor contrast and the axial spatial resolution was measured. Smaller angular disparity led to an improvement in image contrast but at a cost of degraded axial spatial resolution. The improvement in contrast is due to a slight improvement in the in-plane spatial resolution. Since improved contrast should lead to better tumor detectability, smaller angular disparity should be used. However, the difference in contrast between 10 degrees and 15 degrees was very slight and therefore a reasonable clinical choice for angular disparity is 15 degrees", "889": "Synthesis of the control systems via reflection onto auxiliary surfaces. An approach to robust control systems synthesis, both linear and nonlinear, and nonstationary is offered. The control is carried out, providing the given phase constraints varied in acceptable limits, in view of constraints on its value and incompleteness of the information about functioning disturbances. The approach is based on the introduction of auxiliary integral surfaces, on which the initial moving is projected. As a result the reduced equivalent moving is formed, being described by the scalar equation which in many important cases can be integrated directly. On the basis of the equation obtained solving a synthesis task is carried out and can be reduced to algebraic or integral inequalities. The final relations defined for linear equivalent moving are presented", "565": "Control of thin film growth in chemical vapor deposition manufacturing systems: a feasibility study. A study is carried out to design and optimize chemical vapor deposition (CVD) systems for material fabrication. Design and optimization of the CVD process is necessary to satisfying strong global demand and ever increasing quality requirements for thin film production. Advantages of computer aided optimization include high design turnaround time, flexibility to explore a larger design space and the development and adaptation of automation techniques for design and optimization. A CVD reactor consisting of a vertical impinging jet at atmospheric pressure, for growing titanium nitride films, is studied for thin film deposition. Numerical modeling and simulation are used to determine the rate of deposition and film uniformity over a wide range of design variables and operating conditions. These results are used for system design and optimization. The optimization procedure employs an objective function characterizing film quality, productivity and operational costs based on reactor gas flow rate, susceptor temperature and precursor concentration.

This paper proposes a performance tools interface for OpenMP, similar in spirit to the MPI profiling interface in its intent to define a clear and portable API that makes OpenMP execution events visible to runtime performance tools. We present our design using a source-level instrumentation approach based on OpenMP directive rewriting. Rules to instrument each directive and their combination are applied to generate calls to the interface consistent with directive semantics and to pass context information (e.g., source code locations) in a portable and efficient way. Our proposed OpenMP performance API further allows user functions and arbitrary code regions to be marked and performance measurement to be controlled using new OpenMP directives. To prototype the proposed OpenMP performance interface, we have developed compatible performance libraries for the EXPERT automatic event trace analyzer [17, 18] and the TAU performance analysis framework [13]. The directive instrumentation transformations we define are implemented in a source-to-source translation tool called OPARI. Application examples are presented for both EXPERT and TAU to show the OpenMP performance interface and OPARI instrumentation tool in operation.

Hypothetical reasoning is popular in fault diagnostics and design systems, but slow reasoning speed is its drawback.

In hypothetical reasoning systems based on an inference path network, there is much room for improvement regarding the computing costs of connotation processing and consistency checking. The authors of this study demonstrate improvement ideas regarding one of these problems, namely, consistency checking. First, the authors obtained necessary and sufficient conditions under which inconsistencies occur during hypothesis composition. Based on the obtained results, the authors proposed an algorithm for speeding up the process of consistency checking.

Instead, universality is best explained by classical symbol systems, with connectionism as its implementation. Here it is argued that universality is also a problem for classicism in that the syntax-sensitive rules that are supposed to provide causal explanations of mental processes are either too strict, precluding possible generalizations; or too lax, providing no information as to the appropriate alternative.

We present a technique, fully operational and numerically simple, for establishing such bounds. Bounds are dynamic, i.e., they become stronger with the growing number of decisions explicitly identified. They are also parametric with respect to weighting coefficients.

The WorldFIP protocol is one of the profiles that constitute the European fieldbus standard EN-50170. It is particularly well suited to be used in distributed computer-controlled systems where a set of process variables must be shared among network devices. To cope with the real-time requirements of such systems, the protocol provides communication services based on the exchange of periodic and aperiodic identified variables. The periodic exchanges have the highest priority and are executed at run time according to a cyclic schedule. Therefore, the respective schedulability can be determined at pre-run-time when building the schedule table. Concerning the aperiodic exchanges, the situation is different since their priority is lower and they are bandied according to a first-come-first-served policy. In this paper, a response-time-based schedulability analysis for the real-time traffic is presented. Such analysis considers both types of traffic in an integrated way, according to their priorities. Furthermore, a fixed-priorities-based policy is also used to schedule the periodic traffic. The proposed analysis represents an improvement relative to previous work and it can be evaluated online as part of a traffic online admission control. This feature is of particular importance when a planning scheduler is used, instead of the typical offline static scheduler, to allow online changes to the set of periodic process variables", "1112": "Blending parametric patches with subdivision surfaces. In this paper the problem of blending parametric surfaces using subdivision patches is discussed.

Then the approach is employed both to blend parametric bicubic B-spline surfaces and to fill n-sided holes. It is easy to produce piecewise-smooth subdivision surfaces with both convex and concave corners on the boundary, and limit surfaces are guaranteed to be C/sup 2/ continuous on the boundaries except for a few singular points by the removing-boundary approach.

In this arrangement, two three-level inverters that are connected in parallel at their DC sides are feeding the open motor windings. The DSC, well known from two- and three-level inverters, is adapted to the D3LI and optimized for a minimum torque ripple. An 18-corner trajectory is chosen for the stator flux of the induction machine since it is approaching the ideal circle much better than the hexagon known from DSC for two-level inverters, without any detriment to the torque ripple.

The available bit rate (ABR) service class of asynchronous transfer mode networks uses a feedback control mechanism to adapt to varying link capacities.

The improved feedback delay and control of ABR traffic inside closed segments provide a better performance for ABR connections. This article presents the use of classical linear control theory to model and develop an ABR VS/VD flow control algorithm. Discrete event simulations are used to analyze the behavior of the algorithm with respect to transient behavior and correctness of the control model. Linear control theory offers the means to derive correct choices of parameters and to assess performance issues, such as stability of the system, during the design phase. The performance goals are high link utilization, fair bandwidth distribution, and robust operation in various environments, which are verified by discrete event simulations.

Generating a reasonable solution in an acceptable time is necessary for effective automated process planning. Several different heuristics are proposed for solving the welding task-sequencing problem considering both productivity and the potential for welding distortion. Constructive heuristics based on the nearest neighbour concept and tabu search heuristics are developed and enhanced using improvement procedures. The effectiveness of the heuristics developed is tested and verified on actual welded structure problems and random problems", "623": "Stochastic recurrences of Jackpot Keno. We describe a mathematical model and simulation study for Jackpot Keno, as implemented by Jupiters Network Gaming (JNG) in the Australian state of Queensland, and as controlled by the Queensland Office of Gaming Regulation (QOGR) (http://www.qogr.qld.gov.au/keno.shtml). The recurrences for the house net hold are derived and it is seen that these are piecewise linear with a ternary domain split, and further, the split points are stochastic in nature. Since this structure is intractable (Brockett and Levine, Statistics & Probability & their Applications, CBS College Publishing, 1984), estimation of house net hold obtained through an appropriately designed simulator using a random number generator with desirable properties is described. Since the model and simulation naturally derives hold given payscale, but JNG and QOGR require payscale given hold, an inverse problem was required to be solved. This required development of a special algorithm, which may be described as a stochastic binary search. Experimental results are presented, in which the simulator is used to determine jackpot pay-scales so as to satisfy legal requirements of approximately 75% of net revenue returned to the players, i.e., 25% net hold for the house (JNG). Details of the algorithm used to solve this problem are presented, and notwithstanding the stochastic nature of the simulation, convergence to a specified hold for the inverse problem has been achieved to within 0.1% in all cases of interest to date", "1208": "A Virtual Test Facility for the simulation of dynamic response in materials. The Center for Simulating Dynamic Response of Materials at the California Institute of Technology is constructing a virtual shock physics facility for studying the response of various target materials to very strong shocks. The Virtual Test Facility (VTF) is an end-to-end, fully three-dimensional simulation of the detonation of high explosives (HE), shock wave propagation, solid material response to pressure loading, and compressible turbulence. The VTF largely consists of a parallel fluid solver and a parallel solid mechanics package that are coupled together by the exchange of boundary data. The Eulerian fluid code and Lagrangian solid mechanics model interact via a novel approach based on level sets. The two main computational packages are integrated through the use of Pyre, a problem solving environment written in the Python scripting language. Pyre allows application developers to interchange various computational models and solver packages without recompiling code, and it provides standardized access to several data visualization engines and data input mechanisms. In this paper, we outline the main components of the VTF, discuss their integration via Pyre, and describe some recent accomplishments in large-scale simulation using the VTF", "1023": "Simple nonlinear dual-window operator for edge detection. We propose a nonlinear edge detection technique based on a two-concentric-circular-window operator. We perform a preliminary selection of edge candidates using a standard gradient and use the dual-window operator to reveal edges as zero-crossing points of a simple difference function depending only on the minimum and maximum values in the two windows. Comparisons with other well-established techniques are reported in terms of visual appearance and computational efficiency. They show that detected edges are surely comparable with Canny's and Laplacian of Gaussian algorithms, with a noteworthy reduction in terms of computational load", "891": "Establishing the discipline of physics-based CMP modeling.

Since the mid-1980s, expert systems have been developed for a variety of problems in accounting and finance. The most commonly cited problems in developing these systems are the unavailability of the experts and knowledge engineers and difficulties with the rule extraction process. Within the field of artificial intelligence, this has been called the 'knowledge acquisition' (KA) problem and has been identified as a major bottleneck in the expert system development process. Recent empirical research reveals that certain KA techniques are significantly more efficient than others in helping to extract certain types of knowledge within specific problem domains. This paper presents a mapping between these empirical studies and a generic taxonomy of expert system problem domains. To accomplish this, we first examine the range of problem domains and suggest a mapping of accounting and finance tasks to a generic problem domain taxonomy. We then identify and describe the most prominent KA techniques employed in developing expert systems in accounting and finance. After examining and summarizing the existing empirical KA work, we conclude by showing how the empirical KA research in the various problem domains can be used to provide guidance to developers of expert systems in the fields of accounting and finance", "759": "Mathematical properties of dominant AHP and concurrent convergence method. This study discusses the mathematical structure of the dominant AHP and the concurrent convergence method which were originally developed by Kinoshita and Nakanishi. They introduced a new concept of a regulating alternative into an analyzing tool for a simple evaluation problem with a criterion set and an alternative set. Although the original idea of the dominant AHP and the concurrent convergence method is unique, the dominant AHP and the concurrent convergence method are not sufficiently analyzed in mathematical theory. This study shows that the dominant AHP consists of a pair of evaluation rules satisfying a certain property of overall evaluation vectors. This study also shows that the convergence of concurrent convergence method is guaranteed theoretically", "817": "Summarization beyond sentence extraction: A probabilistic approach to sentence compression. When humans produce summaries of documents, they do not simply extract sentences and concatenate them. Rather, they create new sentences that are grammatical, that cohere with one another, and that capture the most salient pieces of information in the original document. Given that large collections of text/abstract pairs are available online, it is now possible to envision algorithms that are trained to mimic this process. In this paper, we focus on sentence compression, a simpler version of this larger challenge. We aim to achieve two goals simultaneously: our compressions should be grammatical, and they should retain the most important pieces of information. These two goals can conflict. We devise both a noisy-channel and a decision-tree approach to the problem, and we evaluate results against manual compressions and a simple baseline", "146": "Design patterns for high availability. It is possible to achieve five-nines reliability with everyday commercial-quality hardware and software. The key is the way in which these components are combined.

Newton's iterator is one of the most popular components of polynomial equation system solvers, either from the numeric or symbolic point of view. This iterator usually handles smooth situations only (when the Jacobian matrix associated to the system is invertible). This is often a restrictive factor. Generalizing Newton's iterator is still an open problem: How to design an efficient iterator with a quadratic convergence even in degenerate cases? We propose an answer for an m-adic topology when the ideal m can be chosen generic enough: compared to a smooth case we prove quadratic convergence with a small overhead that grows with the square of the multiplicity of the root", "572": "Characterization of sheet buckling subjected to controlled boundary constraints. A wedge strip test is designed to study the onset and post-buckling behavior of a sheet under various boundary constraints. The device can be easily incorporated into a conventional tensile test machine, and material resistance to buckling is measured as the buckling height versus the in-plane strain state. The design yields different but consistent buckling modes with easy changes of boundary conditions (either clamped or freed) and sample geometry. Experimental results are then used to verify a hybrid approach to buckling prediction, i.e., the combination of the FEM analysis and an energy-based analytical wrinkling criterion. The FEM analysis is used to obtain the stress field and deformed geometry in a complex forming condition, while the analytical solution is to provide the predictions less sensitive to artificial numerical parameters. A good agreement between experimental data and numerical predictions is obtained", "853": "Virtual Development Center. The Virtual Development Center of the Institute for Women and Technology seeks to significantly enhance the impact of women on technology.

Inspection plays an important role in the semiconductor industry. In this paper, we focus on the inspection task after wire bonding in packaging. The purpose of wire bonding (W/B) is to connect the bond pads with the lead fingers. Two major types of defects are (1) bonding line missing and (2) bonding line breakage. The numbers of bonding lines and bonding balls are used as the features for defect classification. The proposed method consists of image preprocessing, orientation determination, connection detection, bonding line detection, bonding ball detection, and defect classification. The proposed method is simple and fast. The experimental results show that the proposed method can detect the defects effectively", "761": "Towards a NMR implementation of a quantum lattice gas algorithm. Recent theoretical results suggest that an array of quantum information processors communicating via classical channels can be used to solve fluid dynamics problems. Quantum lattice-gas algorithms (QLGA) running on such architectures have been shown to solve the diffusion equation and the nonlinear Burgers equations. In this report, we describe progress towards an ensemble nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) implementation of a QLGA that solves the diffusion equation. The methods rely on NMR techniques to encode an initial mass density into an ensemble of two-qubit quantum information processors. Using standard pulse techniques, the mass density can then manipulated and evolved through the steps of the algorithm. We provide the experimental results of our first attempt to realize the NMR implementation.

Precedent firing control is proposed as a means of remedy, and it is shown by a simulation that the execution time and the total number of waiting operands can be reduced by the precedent firing control. Then the hardware scale is examined as an evaluation of precedent firing control", "1372": "Knowledge acquisition and ontology modelling for construction of a control and monitoring expert system. This paper presents the processes of knowledge acquisition and ontology development for structuring the knowledge base of an expert system.

Ontological engineering in artificial intelligence has the practical goal of constructing frameworks for knowledge that allow computational systems to tackle knowledge-intensive problems and it supports knowledge sharing and reuse.

The opening of voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels has a steep relationship with voltage. In response to changes in the transmembrane voltage, structural movements of an ion channel that precede channel opening generate a capacitative gating current. The net gating charge displacement due to membrane depolarization is an index of the voltage sensitivity of the ion channel activation process. Understanding the molecular basis of voltage-dependent gating of ion channels requires the measurement and computation of the gating charge, Q. We derive a simple and accurate semianalytic approach to computing the voltage dependence of transient gating charge movement (Q-V relationship) of discrete Markov state models of ion channels using matrix methods. This approach allows rapid computation of Q-V curves for finite and infinite length step depolarizations and is consistent with experimentally measured transient gating charge. This computational approach was applied to Shaker potassium channel gating, including the impact of inactivating particles on potassium channel gating currents", "9": "Achieving competitive capabilities in e-services. What implications does the Internet have for service operations strategy? How can business performance of e-service companies be improved in today's knowledge-based economy? These research questions are the subject of the paper. We propose a model that links the e-service company's knowledge-based competencies with their competitive capabilities. Drawing from the current literature, our analysis suggests that services that strategically build a portfolio of knowledge-based competencies, namely human capital, structural capital, and absorptive capacity have more operations-based options, than their counterparts who are less apt to invest. We assume that the combinative capabilities of service quality, delivery, flexibility, and cost are determined by the investment in intellectual capital. Arguably, with the advent of the Internet, different operating models (e.g., bricks-and-mortar, clicks-and-mortar, or pure dot-com) have different strategic imperatives in terms of knowledge-based competencies. Thus, the new e-operations paradigm can be viewed as a configuration of knowledge-based competencies and capabilities", "1093": "A fuzzy logic approach to accommodate thermal stress and improve the start-up phase in combined cycle power plants. Use of combined cycle power generation plant has increased dramatically over the last decade. A supervisory control approach based on a dynamic model is developed, which makes use of proportional-integral-derivative (PID), fuzzy logic and fuzzy PID schemes. The aim is to minimize the steam turbine plant start-up time, without violating maximum thermal stress limits. An existing start-up schedule provides the benchmark by which the performance of candidate controllers is assessed. Improvements regarding possible reduced start-up times and satisfaction of maximum thermal stress restrictions have been realized using the proposed control scheme", "60": "Perceptual audio coding using adaptive pre- and post-filters and lossless compression. This paper proposes a versatile perceptual audio coding method that achieves high compression ratios and is capable of low encoding/decoding delay. It accommodates a variety of source signals (including both music and speech) with different sampling rates. It is based on separating irrelevance and redundancy reductions into independent functional units. This contrasts traditional audio coding where both are integrated within the same subband decomposition. The separation allows for the independent optimization of the irrelevance and redundancy reduction units. For both reductions, we rely on adaptive filtering and predictive coding as much as possible to minimize the delay. A psycho-acoustically controlled adaptive linear filter is used for the irrelevance reduction, and the redundancy reduction is carried out by a predictive lossless coding scheme, which is termed weighted cascaded least mean squared (WCLMS) method. Experiments are carried out on a database of moderate size which contains mono-signals of different sampling rates and varying nature (music, speech, or mixed). They show that the proposed WCLMS lossless coder outperforms other competing lossless coders in terms of compression ratios and delay, as applied to the pre-filtered signal. Moreover, a subjective listening test of the combined pre-filter/lossless coder and a state-of-the-art perceptual audio coder (PAC) shows that the new method achieves a comparable compression ratio and audio quality with a lower delay", "571": "Control of transient thermal response during sequential open-die forging: a trajectory optimization approach. A trajectory optimization approach is applied to the design of a sequence of open-die forging operations in order to control the transient thermal response of a large titanium alloy billet. The amount of time the billet is soaked in furnace prior to each successive forging operation is optimized to minimize the total process time while simultaneously satisfying constraints on the maximum and minimum values of the billet temperature distribution to avoid microstructural defects during forging.

Pastry is used to create and manage groups and to build efficient multicast trees for the dissemination of messages to each group. Scribe provides best-effort reliability guarantees, and we outline how an application can extend Scribe to provide stronger reliability. Simulation results, based on a realistic network topology model, show that Scribe scales across a wide range of groups and group sizes. Also, it balances the load on the nodes while achieving acceptable delay and link stress when compared with Internet protocol multicast", "910": "Control of a heavy-duty robotic excavator using time delay control with integral sliding surface. The control of a robotic excavator is difficult from the standpoint of the following problems: parameter variations in mechanical structures, various nonlinearities in hydraulic actuators and disturbance due to the contact with the ground. In addition, the more the size of robotic excavators increases, the more the length and mass of the excavator links; the more the parameters of a heavy-duty excavator vary. A time-delay control with switching action (TDCSA) using an integral sliding surface is proposed in this paper for the control of a 21-ton robotic excavator. Through analysis and experiments, we show that using an integral sliding surface for the switching action of TDCSA is better than using a PD-type sliding surface. The proposed controller is applied to straight-line motions of a 21-ton robotic excavator with a speed level at which skillful operators work. Experiments, which were designed for surfaces with various inclinations and over broad ranges of joint motions, show that the proposed controller exhibits good performance", "1004": "Games machines play. Individual rationality, or doing what is best for oneself, is a standard model used to explain and predict human behavior, and von Neumann-Morgenstern game theory is the classical mathematical formalization of this theory in multiple-agent settings. Individual rationality, however, is an inadequate model for the synthesis of artificial social systems where cooperation is essential, since it does not permit the accommodation of group interests other than as aggregations of individual interests. Satisficing game theory is based upon a well-defined notion of being good enough, and does accommodate group as well as individual interests through the use of conditional preference relationships, whereby a decision maker is able to adjust its preferences as a function of the preferences, and not just the options, of others. This new theory is offered as an alternative paradigm to construct artificial societies that are capable of complex behavior that goes beyond exclusive self interest", "127": "Asymptotical stability in discrete-time neural networks.

We group segments that \"see\" the same object; this defines the 3D visibility complex. The boundaries of these groups of segments correspond to the visual events of the scene (limits of shadows, disappearance of an object when the viewpoint is moved, etc.). We provide a worst case analysis of the complexity of the visibility complex of 3D scenes, as well as a probabilistic study under a simple assumption for \"normal\" scenes. We extend the visibility complex to handle temporal visibility.

The objective of the paper is to explore questions of human agency and democratic process in the technical sphere through the example of \"virtual community.\" The formation of relatively stable long-term group associations (community in the broad sense of the term), is the scene on which a large share of human development occurs. As such it is a fundamental human value mobilizing diverse ideologies and sensitivities. The promise of realizing this value in a new domain naturally stirs up much excitement among optimistic observers of the Internet. At the same time, the eagerness to place hopes for community in a technical system flies in the face of an influential intellectual tradition of technology criticism. This eagerness seems even more naive in the light of the recent commercialization of so much Internet activity. Despite the widespread skepticism, we believe the growth of virtual community is significant for an inquiry into the democratization of technology. We show that conflicting answers to the central question of the present theoretical debate - Is community possible on computer networks? epsilon neralize from particular features of systems and software prevalent at different stages in the development of computer networking.

For efficient and accurate modelling of railway structural components taking the unbounded media into account, a hybrid method based on a combination of the conventional finite element method and scaled boundary finite element method is established. In the paper, element matrices and solution procedures for the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) are derived.

In this paper on finite element linear quadratic regulator (LQR) vibration control of smart piezoelectric composite plates, we propose the use of the total weighted energy method to select the weighting matrices. By constructing the optimal performance function as a relative measure of the total kinetic energy, strain energy and input energy of the system, only three design variables need to be considered to achieve a balance between the desired higher damping effect and lower input cost. Modal control analysis is used to interpret the effects of three energy weight factors on the damping ratios and modal voltages and it is shown that the modal damping effect will increase with the kinetic energy weight factor, approaching square root (2/2) as the strain energy weight factor increases and decrease with the input energy weight factor. Numerical results agree well with those from the modal control analysis. Since the control problem is simplified to three design variables only, the computational cost will be greatly reduced and a more accurate structural control analysis becomes more attractive for large systems", "1129": "Computing stationary Nash equilibria of undiscounted single-controller stochastic games.

This paper introduces a new statistical approach, namely the probabilistic union model, for speech recognition involving partial, unknown frequency-band corruption. Partial frequency-band corruption accounts for the effect of a family of real-world noises. Previous methods based on the missing feature theory usually require the identity of the noisy bands. This identification can be difficult for unexpected noise with unknown, time-varying band characteristics. The new model combines the local frequency-band information based on the union of random events, to reduce the dependence of the model on information about the noise. This model partially accomplishes the target: offering robustness to partial frequency-band corruption, while requiring no information about the noise. This paper introduces the theory and implementation of the union model, and is focused on several important advances. These new developments include a new algorithm for automatic order selection, a generalization of the modeling principle to accommodate partial feature stream corruption, and a combination of the union model with conventional noise reduction techniques to deal with a mixture of stationary noise and unknown, nonstationary noise. For the evaluation, we used the TIDIGITS database for speaker-independent connected digit recognition. The utterances were corrupted by various types of additive noise, stationary or time-varying, assuming no knowledge about the noise characteristics.

They have been successfully used for solving linear BVPs together with a mesh selection strategy based on the conditioning of the linear systems. Our aim is to extend this approach so as to use them for the numerical approximation of nonlinear problems. For this reason, we consider the quasi-linearization technique that is an application of the Newton method to the nonlinear differential equation. Consequently, each iteration requires the solution of a linear BVP. In order to guarantee the convergence to the solution of the continuous nonlinear problem, it is necessary to determine how accurately the linear BVPs must be solved. For this goal, suitable stopping criteria on the residual and on the error for each linear BVP are given.

Conventional PID-like SISO controllers are still the most common in industry, but with performance requirements becoming tighter there is a growing need for advanced controllers. For the positioning devices in IC-manufacturing, plant interaction is a major performance-limiting factor. MIMO control can be invoked to tackle this problem. A practically feasible procedure is presented to design MIMO feedback controllers for electromechanical positioning devices, using H/sub infinity // mu techniques. Weighting filters are proposed to straightforwardly and effectively impose performance and uncertainty specifications. Experiments show that MIMO control can considerably improve upon the performance with multiloop SISO control. Some problems are highlighted that are important for industrial practice, but lacking a workable solution", "984": "Bistability of harmonically forced relaxation oscillations. Relaxation oscillations appear in processes which involve transitions between two states characterized by fast and slow time scales. When a relaxation oscillator is coupled to an external periodic force its entrainment by the force results in a response which can include multiple periodicities and bistability. The prototype of these behaviors is the harmonically driven van der Pol equation which displays regions in the parameter space of the driving force amplitude where stable orbits of periods 2n+or-1 coexist, flanked by regions of periods 2n+1 and 2n-1. The parameter regions of such bistable orbits are derived analytically for the closely related harmonically driven Stoker-Haag piecewise discontinuous equation. The results are valid over most of the control parameter space of the system. Also considered are the reasons for the more complicated dynamics featuring regions of high multiple periodicity which appear like noise between ordered periodic regions. Since this system mimics in detail the less analytically tractable forced van der Pol equation, the results suggest extensions to situations where forced relaxation oscillations are a component of the operating mechanisms", "1404": "Creating the right mail model.

This paper proposes an inference method which can obtain an approximate solution even if the knowledge stored in the problem-solving system is incomplete. When a rule needed for solving the problem does not exist, the problem can be solved by using rules similar to the existing rules. In an implementation using the SLD procedure, a resolution is executed between a subgoal and a rule if an atom of the subgoal is similar to the consequence atom of the rule. Similarities between atoms are calculated using a knowledge base of words with account of the reasoning situation, and the reliability of the derived solution is calculated based on these similarities. If many solutions are obtained, they are grouped into classes of similar solutions and a representative solution is then selected for each class. The proposed method was verified experimentally by solving simple problems", "932": "Modeling of torsional vibration induced by extension-twisting coupling of anisotropic composite laminates with piezoelectric actuators. In this paper we present a dynamic analytical model for the torsional vibration of an anisotropic piezoelectric laminate induced by the extension-twisting coupling effect. In the present approach, we use the Hamilton principle and a reduced bending stiffness method for the derivation of equations of motion. As a result, the in-plane displacements are not involved and the out-of-plane displacement of the laminate is the only quantity to be calculated. Therefore, the proposed method turns the twisting of a laminate with structural coupling into a simplified problem without losing its features.

This article analyzes the transient buffer content distribution of a queue fed by a large number of Markov fluid sources. We characterize the probability of overflow at time t, given the current buffer level and the number of sources in the on-state. After scaling buffer and bandwidth resources by the number of sources n, we can apply large deviations techniques. The transient overflow probability decays exponentially in n. In the case of exponential on/off sources, we derive an expression for the decay rate of the rare event probability under consideration. For general Markov fluid sources, we present a plausible conjecture. We also provide the \"most likely path\" from the initial state to overflow (at time t). Knowledge of the decay rate and the most likely path to overflow leads to (i) approximations of the transient overflow probability and (ii) efficient simulation methods of the rare event of buffer overflow. The simulation methods, based on importance sampling, give a huge speed-up compared to straightforward simulations. The approximations are of low computational complexity and are accurate, as verified by means of simulation experiments", "140": "A high-resolution high-frequency monolithic top-shooting microinjector free of satellite drops - part II: fabrication, implementation, and characterization.

Virtual reality therapy (VRT), based on this sophisticated technology, has been used in the treatment of subjects diagnosed with acrophobia, a disorder that is characterized by marked anxiety upon exposure to heights and avoidance of heights. Conventional VR systems for the treatment of acrophobia have limitations, over-costly devices or somewhat unrealistic graphic scenes. The goal of this study was to develop an inexpensive and more realistic virtual environment (VE) in which to perform exposure therapy for acrophobia. It is based on a personal computer, and a virtual scene of a bunge-jump tower in the middle of a large city. The virtual scenario includes an open lift surrounded by props beside a tower, which allows the patient to feel a sense of heights. The effectiveness of the VE was evaluated through the clinical treatment of a subject who was suffering from the fear of heights. As a result, it was proved that this VR environment was effective and realistic at overcoming acrophobia according not only to the comparison results of a variety of questionnaires before and after treatment but also to the subject's comments that the VE seemed to evoke more fearful feelings than the real situation", "892": "Dementing disorders: volumetric measurement of cerebrospinal fluid to distinguish normal from pathologic finding - feasibility study.

We describe fair layered increase/decrease with dynamic layering (FLID-DL): a new multirate congestion control algorithm for layered multicast sessions. FLID-DL generalizes the receiver-driven layered congestion control protocol (RLC) introduced by Vicisano et al. (Proc. IEEE INFOCOM, San Francisco, CA, , p.996-1003, Mar. 1998)ameliorating the problems associated with large Internet group management protocol (IGMP) leave latencies and abrupt rate increases. Like RLC, FLID-DL, is a scalable, receiver-driven congestion control mechanism in which receivers add layers at sender-initiated synchronization points and leave layers when they experience congestion. FLID-DL congestion control coexists with transmission control protocol (TCP) flows as well as other FLID-DL sessions and supports general rates on the different multicast layers. We demonstrate via simulations that our congestion control scheme exhibits better fairness properties and provides better throughput than previous methods. A key contribution that enables FLID-DL and may be useful elsewhere is dynamic layering (DL), which mitigates the negative impact of long IGMP leave latencies and eliminates the need for probe intervals present in RLC. We use DL to respond to congestion much faster than IGMP leave operations, which have proven to be a bottleneck in practice for prior work", "1296": "Development of visual design steering as an aid in large-scale multidisciplinary design optimization. I. Method development. A modified paradigm of computational steering (CS), termed visual design steering (VDS), is developed in this paper. The VDS paradigm is applied to optimal design problems to provide a means for capturing and enabling designer insights. VDS allows a designer to make decisions before, during or after an analysis or optimization via a visual environment, in order to effectively steer the solution process. The objective of VDS is to obtain a better solution in less time through the use of designer knowledge and expertise. Using visual representations of complex systems in this manner enables human experience and judgement to be incorporated into the optimal design process at appropriate steps, rather than having traditional black box solvers return solutions from a prescribed input set. Part I of this paper focuses on the research issues pertaining to the Graph Morphing visualization method created to represent an n-dimensional optimization problem using 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visualizations. Part II investigates the implementation of the VDS paradigm, using the graph morphing approach, to improve an optimal design process. Specifically, the following issues are addressed: impact of design variable changes on the optimal design space; identification of possible constraint redundancies; impact of constraint tolerances on the optimal solution: and smoothness of the objective function contours. It is demonstrated that graph morphing can effectively reduce the complexity and computational time associated with some optimization problems", "573": "ECG-gated /sup 18/F-FDG positron emission tomography. Single test evaluation of segmental metabolism, function and contractile reserve in patients with coronary artery disease and regional dysfunction. /sup 18/F-fluorodeoxyglucose (/sup 18/F-FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) provides information about myocardial glucose metabolism to diagnose myocardial viability. Additional information about the functional status is necessary. Comparison of tomographic metabolic PET with data from other imaging techniques is always hampered by some transfer uncertainty and scatter. We wanted to evaluate a new Fourier-based ECG-gated PET technique using a high resolution scanner providing both metabolic and functional data with respect to feasibility in patients with diseased left ventricles. Forty-five patients with coronary artery disease and at least one left ventricular segment with severe hypokinesis or akinesis at biplane cineventriculography were included. A new Fourier-based ECG-gated metabolic /sup 18/F-FDG-PET was performed in these patients. Function at rest and /sup 18/F-FDG uptake were examined in the PET study using a 36-segment model. Segmental comparison with ventriculography revealed a high reliability in identifying dysfunctional segments (>96%). /sup 18/F-FDG uptake of normokinetic/hypokinetic/akinetic segments was 75.4+or-7.5, 65.3+or-10.5, and 35.9+or-15.2% (p<0.001). In segments >or=70% /sup 18/F-FDG uptake no akinesia was observed. No residual function was found below 40% /sup 18/F-FDG uptake. An additional dobutamine test was performed and revealed inotropic reserve (viability) in 42 akinetic segments and 45 hypokinetic segments. ECG-gated metabolic PET with pixel-based Fourier smoothing provides reliable data on regional function. Assessment of metabolism and function makes complete judgement of segmental status feasible within a single study without any transfer artefacts or test-to-test variability.

Introduces an innovative microinjector design, featuring a bubble valve, which entails superior droplet ejection characteristics and monolithic fabrication, which allows handling of a wide range of liquids. This new microinjector uses asymmetric bubbles to reduce crosstalk, increase frequency response and eliminate satellite droplets. During a firing, i.e., droplet ejection, the \"virtual valve\" closes, by growing a thermal bubble in the microchannel, to isolate the microchamber from the liquid supply and neighboring chambers. Between firings, however, the virtual valve opens, by collapsing the bubble, to reduce flow restriction for fast refilling of the microchamber. The use of bubble valves brings about fast and reliable device operation without imposing the significant complication fabrication of physical microvalves would call for. In addition, through a special heater configuration and chamber designs, bubbles surrounding the nozzle cut off the tail of the droplets being ejected and completely eliminate satellite droplets. A simple one-dimensional model of the operation of the microinjector is used to estimate the bubble formation and liquid refilling", "706": "Enhancing the reliability of modular medium-voltage drives.

In this paper, a low-complexity programmable cellular automata (PCA) based versatile modular multiplier in GF(2/sup m/) is presented. The proposed versatile multiplier increases flexibility by using the same multiplier in different security environments, and it reduces the user's cost. Moreover, the multiplier can be easily extended to high order of m for more security, and low-cost serial implementation is feasible in restricted computing environments, such as smart cards and wireless devices", "745": "Intensity based affine registration including feature similarity for spatial normalization. This paper presents a new spatial normalization with affine transformation. The quantitative comparison of brain architecture across different subjects requires a common coordinate system. For the analysis of a specific brain area, it is necessary to normalize and compare a region of interest and the global brain. The intensity based registration method matches the global brain well, but a region of interest may not be locally normalized compared to the feature based method. The method in this paper uses feature similarities of local regions as well as intensity similarities. The lateral ventricle and central gray nuclei of the brain, including the corpus callosum, which is used for features in schizophrenia detection, is appropriately normalized. Our method reduces the difference of feature areas such as the corpus callosum (7.7%, 2.4%) and lateral ventricle (8.2%, 13.5%) compared with mutual information and Talairach methods", "1342": "Defending against flooding-based distributed denial-of-service attacks: a tutorial. Flooding-based distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack presents a very serious threat to the stability of the Internet. In a typical DDoS attack, a large number of compromised hosts are amassed to send useless packets to jam a victim, or its Internet connection, or both. In the last two years, it was discovered that DDoS attack methods and tools are becoming more sophisticated, effective, and also more difficult to trace to the real attackers. On the defense side, current technologies are still unable to withstand large-scale attacks. The main purpose of this article is therefore twofold. The first one is to describe various DDoS attack methods, and to present a systematic review and evaluation of the existing defense mechanisms. The second is to discuss a longer-term solution, dubbed the Internet-firewall approach, that attempts to intercept attack packets in the Internet core, well before reaching the victim", "855": "Support communities for women in computing. This article highlights the many activities provided by the support communities available for women in computing.

This article surveys some of these organizations and concludes with a list of suggestions for how faculty members can incorporate the benefits of these organizations in their own institutions", "958": "Efficient combinational verification using overlapping local BDDs and a hash table. We propose a novel methodology that combines local BDDs (binary decision diagrams) with a hash table for very efficient verification of combinational circuits. The main purpose of this technique is to remove the considerable overhead associated with case-by-case verification of internal node pairs in typical internal correspondence based verification methods. Two heuristics based on the number of structural levels of circuitry looked at and the total number of nodes in the BDD manager are used to control the BDD sizes and introduce new cutsets based on already found equivalent nodes. We verify the ISCAS85 benchmark circuits and demonstrate significant speedup over existing methods. We also verify several hard industrial circuits and show our superiority in extracting internal equivalences", "801": "International customers, suppliers, and document delivery in a fee-based information service. The Purdue University Libraries library fee-based information service, the Technical Information Service (TIS), works with both international customers and international suppliers to meet its customers' needs for difficult and esoteric document requests. Successful completion of these orders requires the ability to verify fragmentary citations; ascertain documents' availability; obtain pricing information; calculate inclusive cost quotes; meet customers' deadlines; accept international payments; and ship across borders. While international orders make tip a small percent of the total workload, these challenging and rewarding orders meet customers' needs and offer continuous improvement opportunities to the staff", "787": "New kit on the block [IT upgrades].

Its employees probably need to adhere to new procurement policies, work more closely with colleagues in other departments, meet more exacting sales targets, and offer higher standards of customer service and support. In short, they need to change the way they work. Implementing technologies to support agile business models and underpin new practices is a complex task in itself.

Nested Petri nets (NP-nets) is a Petri net extension, allowing tokens in a net marking to be represented by marked nets themselves. The paper discusses applicability of NP-nets for modeling task planning systems, multi-agent systems and recursive-parallel systems. A comparison of NP-nets with some other formalisms, such as OPNs of R. Valk (2000), recursive parallel programs of O. Kushnarenko and Ph. Schnoebelen (1997) and process algebras is given. Some aspects of decidability for object-oriented Petri net extensions are also discussed", "1084": "On quasi-linear PDAEs with convection: applications, indices, numerical solution. For a class of partial differential algebraic equations (PDAEs) of quasi-linear type which include nonlinear terms of convection type, a possibility to determine a time and spatial index is considered. As a typical example we investigate an application from plasma physics. Especially we discuss the numerical solution of initial boundary value problems by means of a corresponding finite difference splitting procedure which is a modification of a well-known fractional step method coupled with a matrix factorization. The convergence of the numerical solution towards the exact solution of the corresponding initial boundary value problem is investigated. Some results of a numerical solution of the plasma PDAE are given", "1064": "Quantum-controlled measurement device for quantum-state discrimination. We propose a \"programmable\" quantum device that is able to perform a specific generalized measurement from a certain set of measurements depending on a quantum state of a \"program register.\" In particular, we study a situation when the programmable measurement device serves for the unambiguous discrimination between nonorthogonal states. The particular pair of states that can be unambiguously discriminated is specified by the state of a program qubit. The probability of successful discrimination is not optimal for all admissible pairs. However, for some subsets it can be very close to the optimal value", "1407": "Soft options for software upgrades?. Several new products claim to take the work out of installing software and patches, and even migrating operating systems. Software migration products fall into two broad categories. The drive imaging type is designed to make exact copies of a hard disk, either an entire drive or certain directories, so you can use it to back up data. The application management type is designed for more incremental upgrades and often provides additional features such as the ability to monitor or control users' access to applications", "1205": "HPCVIEW: a tool for top-down analysis of node performance. It is increasingly difficult for complex scientific programs to attain a significant fraction of peak performance on systems that are based on microprocessors with substantial instruction-level parallelism and deep memory hierarchies. Despite this trend, performance analysis and tuning tools are still not used regularly by algorithm and application designers. To a large extent, existing performance tools fail to meet many user needs and are cumbersome to use. To address these issues, we developed HPCVIEW - a toolkit for combining multiple sets of program profile data, correlating the data with source code, and generating a database that can be analyzed anywhere with a commodity Web browser. We argue that HPCVIEW addresses many of the issues that have limited the usability and the utility of most existing tools. We originally built HPCVIEW to facilitate our own work on data layout and optimizing compilers. Now, in addition to daily use within our group, HPCVIEW is being used by several code development teams in DoD and DoE laboratories as well as at NCSA", "735": "IT at the heart of joined-up policing.

It is well known that the edge geometry of a cutting tool affects the forces measured in metal cutting. Two experimental methods have been suggested in the past to extract the ploughing (non-cutting) component from the total measured force: (1) the extrapolation approach, and (2) the dwell force technique. This study reports the behavior of zinc during orthogonal machining using tools of controlled edge radius. Applications of both the extrapolation and dwell approaches show that neither produces an analysis that yields a material response consistent with the known behavior of zinc. Further analysis shows that the edge geometry modifies the shear zone of the material and thereby modifies the forces. When analyzed this way, the measured force data yield the expected material response without requiring recourse to an additional ploughing component", "66": "Regression testing of database applications. Database applications features such as Structured Query Language or SQL, exception programming, integrity constraints, and table triggers pose difficulties for maintenance activities; especially for regression testing that follows modifications to database applications. In this work, we address these difficulties and propose a two phase regression testing methodology. In phase 1, we explore control flow and data flow analysis issues of database applications. Then, we propose an impact analysis technique that is based on dependencies that exist among the components of database applications. This analysis leads to selecting test cases from the initial test suite for regression testing the modified application. In phase 2, further reduction in the regression test cases is performed by using reduction algorithms. We present two such algorithms. The Graph Walk algorithm walks through the control flow graph of database modules and selects a safe set of test cases to retest. The Call Graph Firewall algorithm uses a firewall for the inter procedural level. Finally, a maintenance environment for database applications is described. Our experience with this regression testing methodology shows that the impact analysis technique is adequate for selecting regression tests and that phase 2 techniques can be used for further reduction in the number of theses tests", "1241": "Code generator for the HPF Library and Fortran 95 transformational functions. One of the language features of the core language of HPF 2.0 (High Performance Fortran) is the HPF Library. The HPF Library consists of 55 generic functions. The implementation of this library presents the challenge that all data types, data kinds, array ranks and input distributions need to be supported. For instance, more than 2 billion separate functions are required to support COPY-SCATTER fully. The efficient support of these billions of specific functions is one of the outstanding problems of HPF. We have solved this problem by developing a library generator which utilizes the mechanism of parameterized templates. This mechanism allows the procedures to be instantiated at compile time for arguments with a specific type, kind, rank and distribution over a specific processor array. We describe the algorithms used in the different library functions. The implementation gives the ease of generating a large number of library routines from a single template. The templates can be extended with special code for specific combinations of the input arguments. We describe in detail the implementation and performance of the matrix multiplication template for the Fujitsu VPP5000 platform", "556": "Coarse-grained reduction and analysis of a network model of cortical response: I. Drifting grating stimuli. We present a reduction of a large-scale network model of visual cortex developed by McLaughlin, Shapley, Shelley, and Wielaard. The reduction is from many integrate-and-fire neurons to a spatially coarse-grained system for firing rates of neuronal subpopulations. It accounts explicitly for spatially varying architecture, ordered cortical maps (such as orientation preference) that vary regularly across the cortical layer, and disordered cortical maps (such as spatial phase preference or stochastic input conductances) that may vary widely from cortical neuron to cortical neuron. The result of the reduction is a set of nonlinear spatiotemporal integral equations for \"phase-averaged\" firing rates of neuronal subpopulations across the model cortex, derived asymptotically from the full model without the addition of any extra phenomological constants. This reduced system is used to study the response of the model to drifting grating stimuli - where it is shown to be useful for numerical investigations that reproduce, at far less computational cost, the salient features of the point-neuron network and for analytical investigations that unveil cortical mechanisms behind the responses observed in the simulations of the large-scale computational model. For example, the reduced equations clearly show (1) phase averaging as the source of the time-invariance of cortico-cortical conductances, (2) the mechanisms in the model for higher firing rates and better orientation selectivity of simple cells which are near pinwheel centers, (3) the effects of the length-scales of cortico-cortical coupling, and (4) the role of noise in improving the contrast invariance of orientation selectivity", "874": "The curious ways of professional cultures and the \"two-body opportunity\". When two professionals are a couple, we sometimes refer to them as having a \"two-body problem.\" However, when each partner of a couple exists in the same cultures, they also have an opportunity for deeply shared understanding and empathy, simply because each understands at a deep level the culture in which the other works. I explore this notion. A couple has what we call the \"two-body problem\" when both are professionals who are qualified for a kind of position that is relatively rare and who are very selective about the positions that they accept. For example, there are relatively scant numbers of jobs as a computer science professor-at any level. An individual considering an academic job may only be interested in research universities, or in teaching universities, restricting the choice of open positions substantially. The classic two-body \"problem\" arises when one partner wants to accept a new position that requires geographical relocation. Then, the other partner also needs to find a new position. Moreover, it can be very difficult to find a suitable position when they are naturally scarce", "1057": "Acceptance of a price discount: the role of the semantic relatedness between purchases and the comparative price format. Two studies are reported where people are asked to accept or not a price reduction on a target product. In the high (low) relative saving version, the regular price of the target product is low (high). In both versions, the absolute value of the price reduction is the same as well as the total of regular prices of planned purchases. As first reported by Tversky and Kahneman (1981), findings show that the majority of people accept the price discount in the high-relative saving version whereas the minority do it in the low one. In Study 1, findings show that the previous preference reversal disappears when planned purchases are strongly related. Also, a previously unreported preference reversal is found. The majority of people accept the price discount when the products are weakly related whereas the minority accept when the products are strongly related. In Study 2, findings show that the classic preference reversal disappears as a function of the comparative price format. Also, another previously unreported preference reversal is found. When the offered price reduction relates to a low-priced product, people are more inclined to accept it with a control than a minimal comparative price format. Findings reported in Studies 1 and 2 are interpreted in terms of mental accounting shifts", "912": "Grey-box model identification via evolutionary computing. This paper presents an evolutionary grey-box model identification methodology that makes the best use of a priori knowledge on a clear-box model with a global structural representation of the physical system under study, whilst incorporating accurate blackbox models for immeasurable and local nonlinearities of a practical system. The evolutionary technique is applied to building dominant structural identification with local parametric tuning without the need of a differentiable performance index in the presence of noisy data. It is shown that the evolutionary technique provides an excellent fitting performance and is capable of accommodating multiple objectives such as to examine the relationships between model complexity and fitting accuracy during the model building process. Validation results show that the proposed method offers robust, uncluttered and accurate models for two practical systems. It is expected that this type of grey-box models will accommodate many practical engineering systems for a better modelling accuracy", "1448": "Implementing equals for mixed-type comparison. The idea of comparing objects of different types is not entirely off base, in particular for classes from the same class hierarchy. After all, objects from the same class hierarchy (and by class hierarchy we mean all classes derived from a common superclass other than Object) have something in common, namely at least the superclass part. As we demonstrated in a previous paper (2002), providing a correct implementation of a mixed-type comparison is a non-trivial task. In this article, we will show one way of implementing a mixed-type comparison of objects from the same class hierarchy that meets the requirements of the equals contract"}
