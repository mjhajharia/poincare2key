{"7833551": "Evolutionary spectral clustering by incorporating temporal smoothness . Evolutionary clustering is an emerging research area essential to important applications such as clustering dynamic Web and blog contents and clustering data streams . In evolutionary clustering , a good clustering result should fit the current data well , while simultaneously not deviate too dramatically from the recent history . To fulfill this dual purpose , a measure of temporal smoothness is integrated in the overall measure of clustering quality . In this paper , we propose two frameworks that incorporate temporal smoothness in evolutionary spectral clustering . For both frameworks , we start with intuitions gained from the well-known k-means clustering problem , and then propose and solve corresponding cost functions for the evolutionary spectral clustering problems . Our solutions to the evolutionary spectral clustering problems provide more stable and consistent clustering results that are less sensitive to short-term noises while at the same time are adaptive to long-term cluster drifts . Furthermore , we demonstrate that our methods provide the optimal solutions to the relaxed versions of the corresponding evolutionary k-means clustering problems . Performance experiments over a number of real and synthetic data sets illustrate our evolutionary spectral clustering methods provide more robust clustering results that are not sensitive to noise and can adapt to data drifts .", "13537024": "Toward autonomic grids : analyzing the job flow with affinity streaming .

For the discovery of similar patterns in 1D time-series , it is very typical to perform a normalization of the data ( for example a transformation so that the data follow a zero mean and unit standard deviation ) . Such transformations can reveal latent patterns and are very commonly used in datamining applications . However , when dealing with multidimensional time-series , which appear naturally in applications such as video-tracking , motion-capture etc , similar motion patterns can also be expressed at different orientations . It is therefore imperative to provide support for additional transformations , such as rotation .

Our distance measure in the new space is able to detect elastic matches and can be efficiently lower bounded , thus being computationally tractable .

Kernel methods have been applied successfully in many data mining tasks . Subspace kernel learning was recently proposed to discover an effective low-dimensional subspace of a kernel feature space for improved classification . In this paper , we propose to construct a subspace kernel using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion ( HSIC ) . We show that the optimal subspace kernel can be obtained efficiently by solving an eigenvalue problem . One limitation of the existing subspace kernel learning formulations is that the kernel learning and classification are independent and the subspace kernel may not be optimally adapted for classification . To overcome this limitation , we propose a joint optimization framework , in which we learn the subspace kernel and subsequent classifiers simultaneously . In addition , we propose a novel learning formulation that extracts an uncorrelated subspace kernel to reduce the redundant information in a subspace kernel . Following the idea from multiple kernel learning , we extend the proposed formulations to the case when multiple kernels are available and need to be combined . We show that the integration of subspace kernels can be formulated as a semidefinite program ( SDP ) which is computationally expensive . To improve the efficiency of the SDP formulation , we propose an equivalent semi-infinite linear program ( SILP ) formulation which can be solved efficiently by the column generation technique .

Our measure of approximating a collection of sets by k sets is defined to be the size of the collection covered by the the k sets , i.e. , the part of the collection that is included in one of the k sets .

With the development of Web applications , textual documents are not only getting richer , but also ubiquitously interconnected with users and other objects in various ways , which brings about text-rich heterogeneous information networks . Topic models have been proposed and shown to be useful for document analysis , and the interactions among multi-typed objects play a key role at disclosing the rich semantics of the network . However , most of topic models only consider the textual information while ignore the network structures or can merely integrate with homogeneous networks .

Consequently , we investigate and develop two biased propagation frameworks , the biased random walk framework and the biased regularization framework , for the TMBP algorithm from different perspectives , which can discover latent topics and identify clusters of multi-typed objects simultaneously .

We consider the problem of improving named entity recognition ( NER ) systems by using external dictionaries -- more specifically , the problem of extending state-of-the-art NER systems by incorporating information about the similarity of extracted entities to entities in an external dictionary . This is difficult because most high-performance named entity recognition systems operate by sequentially classifying words as to whether or not they participate in an entity name ; however , the most useful similarity measures score entire candidate names . To correct this mismatch we formalize a semi-Markov extraction process , which is based on sequentially classifying segments of several adjacent words , rather than single words . In addition to allowing a natural way of coupling high-performance NER methods and high-performance similarity functions , this formalism also allows the direct use of other useful entity-level features , and provides a more natural formulation of the NER problem than sequential word classification . Experiments in multiple domains show that the new model can substantially improve extraction performance over previous methods for using external dictionaries in NER .", "4740231": "Short term performance forecasting in enterprise systems .

Outlier detection is an important task in data mining with numerous applications , including credit card fraud detection , video surveillance , etc. . A recent work on outlier detection has introduced a novel notion of local outlier in which the degree to which an object is outlying is dependent on the density of its local neighborhood , and each object can be assigned a Local Outlier Factor ( LOF ) which represents the likelihood of that object being an outlier . Although the concept of local outliers is a useful one , the computation of LOF values for every data objects requires a large number of & kgr ; - nearest neighbors searches and can be computationally expensive . Since most objects are usually not outliers , it is useful to provide users with the option of finding only n most outstanding local outliers , i.e. , the top-n data objects which are most likely to be local outliers according to their LOFs . However , if the pruning is not done carefully , finding top-n outliers could result in the same amount of computation as finding LOF for all objects . In this paper , we propose a novel method to efficiently find the top-n local outliers in large databases . The concept of `` micro-cluster '' is introduced to compress the data . An efficient micro-cluster-based local outlier mining algorithm is designed based on this concept . As our algorithm can be adversely affected by the overlapping in the micro-clusters , we proposed a meaningful cut-plane solution for overlapping data . The formal analysis and experiments show that this method can achieve good performance in finding the most outstanding local outliers .", "1473866": "Adaptive duplicate detection using learnable string similarity measures .

Existing association rule mining algorithms suffer from many problems when mining massive transactional datasets .

Another major impediment is the repetitive and interactive nature of any knowledge discovery process . To tune parameters , many runs of the same algorithms are necessary leading to the building of these huge data structures time and again . This paper proposes a new disk-based association rule mining algorithm called Inverted Matrix , which achieves its efficiency by applying three new ideas . First , transactional data is converted into a new database layout called Inverted Matrix that prevents multiple scanning of the database during the mining phase , in which finding frequent patterns could be achieved in less than a full scan with random access . Second , for each frequent item , a relatively small independent tree is built summarizing co-occurrences . Finally , a simple and non-recursive mining process reduces the memory requirements as minimum candidacy generation and counting is needed .

With the development of genome sequencing technology and bioinformatics , biologists can now deduce all the proteins that are likely produced in a given bacteria and have attempted to classify where proteins are located in a bacterial cell . However such protein localization programs are currently least accurate when predicting OMPs , and so there is a current need for the development of a better OMP classifier . Data mining research suggests that the use of frequent patterns has good performance in aiding the development of accurate and efficient classification algorithms . In this paper , we present two methods to identify OMPs based on frequent subsequences and test them on all Gram-negative bacterial proteins whose localizations have been determined by biological experiments . One classifier follows an association rule approach , while the other is based on support vector machines ( SVMs ) . We compare the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art methods in the biological domain . The results demonstrate that our methods are better both in terms of accurately identifying OMPs and providing biological insights that increase our understanding of the structures and functions of these important proteins .", "887837": "ADMIT : anomaly-based data mining for intrusions .

This paper describes a novel classification method for computer aided detection ( CAD ) that identifies structures of interest from medical images . CAD problems are challenging largely due to the following three characteristics . Typical CAD training data sets are large and extremely unbalanced between positive and negative classes . When searching for descriptive features , researchers often deploy a large set of experimental features , which consequently introduces irrelevant and redundant features . Finally , a CAD system has to satisfy stringent real-time requirements . This work is distinguished by three key contributions . The first is a cascade classification approach which is able to tackle all the above difficulties in a unified framework by employing an asymmetric cascade of sparse classifiers each trained to achieve high detection sensitivity and satisfactory false positive rates . The second is the incorporation of feature computational costs in a linear program formulation that allows the feature selection process to take into account different evaluation costs of various features . The third is a boosting algorithm derived from column generation optimization to effectively solve the proposed cascade linear programs . We apply the proposed approach to the problem of detecting lung nodules from helical multi-slice CT images .

Incomplete data sets have become almost ubiquitous in a wide variety of application domains . Common examples can be found in climate and image data sets , sensor data sets and medical data sets . The incompleteness in these data sets may arise from a number of factors : in some cases it may simply be a reflection of certain measurements not being available at the time ; in others the information may be lost due to partial system failure ; or it may simply be a result of users being unwilling to specify attributes due to privacy concerns . When a significant fraction of the entries are missing in all of the attributes , it becomes very difficult to perform any kind of reasonable extrapolation on the original data . For such cases , we introduce the novel idea of conceptual reconstruction , in which we create effective conceptual representations on which the data mining algorithms can be directly applied . The attraction behind the idea of conceptual reconstruction is to use the correlation structure of the data in order to express it in terms of concepts rather the original dimensions .

In this paper , we present a learning-based approach to broad matching that is based on exploiting implicit feedback in the form of advertisement clickthrough logs . Our method can utilize arbitrary similarity functions by incorporating them as features . We present an online learning algorithm , Amnesiac Averaged Perceptron , that is highly efficient yet able to quickly adjust to the rapidly-changing distributions of bidded keywords , advertisements and user behavior . Experimental results obtained from ( 1 ) historical logs and ( 2 ) live trials on a large-scale advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the overall success of our approach in identifying high-quality broad match mappings .", "497718": "SimRank : a measure of structural-context similarity . The problem of measuring `` similarity '' of objects arises in many applications , and many domain-specific measures have been developed , e.g. , matching text across documents or computing overlap among item-sets .

Effectively , we compute a measure that says `` two objects are similar if they are related to similar objects : '' This general similarity measure , called SimRank , is based on a simple and intuitive graph-theoretic model . For a given domain , SimRank can be combined with other domain-specific similarity measures . We suggest techniques for efficient computation of SimRank scores , and provide experimental results on two application domains showing the computational feasibility and effectiveness of our approach .", "4677655": "Cleaning disguised missing data : a heuristic approach . In some applications such as filling in a customer information form on the web , some missing values may not be explicitly represented as such , but instead appear as potentially valid data values . Such missing values are known as disguised missing data , which may impair the quality of data analysis severely , such as causing significant biases and misleading results in hypothesis tests , correlation analysis and regressions . The very limited previous studies on cleaning disguised missing data use outlier mining and distribution anomaly detection . They highly rely on domain background knowledge in specific applications and may not work well for the cases where the disguise values are inliers . To tackle the problem of cleaning disguised missing data , in this paper , we first model the distribution of disguised missing data , and propose the embedded unbiased sample heuristic . Then , we develop an effective and efficient method to identify the frequently used disguise values which capture the major body of the disguised missing data . Our method does not require any domain background knowledge to find the suspicious disguise values . We report an empirical evaluation using real data sets , which shows that our method is effective - the frequently used disguise values found by our method match the values identified by the domain experts nicely . Our method is also efficient and scalable for processing large data sets .", "14076694": "Mining sequential patterns from probabilistic databases . We consider sequential pattern mining in situations where there is uncertainty about which source an event is associated with . We model this in the probabilistic database framework and consider the problem of enumerating all sequences whose expected support is sufficiently large . Unlike frequent itemset mining in probabilistic databases ( C. Aggarwal et al. .

Next , we embed this DP algorithm into candidate generate-and-test approaches , and explore the pattern lattice both in a breadth-first ( similar to GSP ) and a depth-first ( similar to SPAM ) manner . We propose optimizations for efficiently computing the frequent 1-sequences , for re-using previously-computed results through incremental support computation , and for elmiminating candidate sequences without computing their support via probabilistic pruning .

Second , the prior knowledge should be considered right from the start to focus the search on unexpected rules . Third , the unexpectedness of a rule depends on what other rules the user has seen so far . Thus , only rules that remain unexpected given what the user has seen should be considered interesting .

Unlike prior work that views constraints as boolean criteria , we present a formulation that allows constraints to be satisfied or violated in a smooth manner . This enables us to achieve dependent clustering and disparate clustering using the same optimization framework by merely maximizing versus minimizing the objective function .

In many online social systems , social ties between users play an important role in dictating their behavior . One of the ways this can happen is through social influence , the phenomenon that the actions of a user can induce his\\/her friends to behave in a similar way . In systems where social influence exists , ideas , modes of behavior , or new technologies can diffuse through the network like an epidemic . Therefore , identifying and understanding social influence is of tremendous interest from both analysis and design points of view . This is a difficult task in general , since there are factors such as homophily or unobserved confounding variables that can induce statistical correlation between the actions of friends in a social network . Distinguishing influence from these is essentially the problem of distinguishing correlation from causality , a notoriously hard statistical problem . In this paper we study this problem systematically . We define fairly general models that replicate the aforementioned sources of social correlation . We then propose two simple tests that can identify influence as a source of social correlation when the time series of user actions is available . We give a theoretical justification of one of the tests by proving that with high probability it succeeds in ruling out influence in a rather general model of social correlation . We also simulate our tests on a number of examples designed by randomly generating actions of nodes on a real social network ( from Flickr ) according to one of several models . Simulation results confirm that our test performs well on these data . Finally , we apply them to real tagging data on Flickr , exhibiting that while there is significant social correlation in tagging behavior on this system , this correlation can not be attributed to social influence .", "9485675": "Knowledge transfer via multiple model local structure mapping . The effectiveness of knowledge transfer using classification algorithms depends on the difference between the distribution that generates the training examples and the one from which test examples are to be drawn . The task can be especially difficult when the training examples are from one or several domains different from the test domain . In this paper , we propose a locally weighted ensemble framework to combine multiple models for transfer learning , where the weights are dynamically assigned according to a model 's predictive power on each test example . It can integrate the advantages of various learning algorithms and the labeled information from multiple training domains into one unified classification model , which can then be applied on a different domain . Importantly , different from many previously proposed methods , none of the base learning method is required to be specifically designed for transfer learning . We show the optimality of a locally weighted ensemble framework as a general approach to combine multiple models for domain transfer . We then propose an implementation of the local weight assignments by mapping the structures of a model onto the structures of the test domain , and then weighting each model locally according to its consistency with the neighborhood structure around the test example . Experimental results on text classification , spam filtering and intrusion detection data sets demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy gained by the framework . On a transfer learning task of newsgroup message categorization , the proposed locally weighted ensemble framework achieves 97 % accuracy when the best single model predicts correctly only on 73 % of the test examples . In summary , the improvement in accuracy is over 10 % and up to 30 % across different problems .", "5143105": "Nonlinear adaptive distance metric learning for clustering . A good distance metric is crucial for many data mining tasks . To learn a metric in the unsupervised setting , most metric learning algorithms project observed data to a low-dimensional manifold , where geometric relationships such as pairwise distances are preserved . It can be extended to the nonlinear case by applying the kernel trick , which embeds the data into a feature space by specifying the kernel function that computes the dot products between data points in the feature space . In this paper , we propose a novel unsupervised Nonlinear Adaptive Metric Learning algorithm , called NAML , which performs clustering and distance metric learning simultaneously . NAML firstmaps the data to a high-dimensional space through a kernel function ; then applies a linear projection to find a low-dimensional manifold where the separability of the data is maximized ; and finally performs clustering in the low-dimensional space . The performance of NAML depends on the selection of the kernel function and the projection .

Our formulation takes as inputs the detailed purchase information of each consumer , with which we construct a weighted directed graph whose nodes correspond to consumers and whose edges correspond to purchases consumers have in common ; the edge weights indicate how frequently consumers purchase products earlier than other consumers .

Many scalable data mining tasks rely on active learning to provide the most useful accurately labeled instances . However , what if there are multiple labeling sources ( ` oracles ' or ` experts ' ) with different but unknown reliabilities ? With the recent advent of inexpensive and scalable online annotation tools , such as Amazon 's Mechanical Turk , the labeling process has become more vulnerable to noise - and without prior knowledge of the accuracy of each individual labeler . This paper addresses exactly such a challenge : how to jointly learn the accuracy of labeling sources and obtain the most informative labels for the active learning task at hand minimizing total labeling effort . More specifically , we present IEThresh ( Interval Estimate Threshold ) as a strategy to intelligently select the expert ( s ) with the highest estimated labeling accuracy . IEThresh estimates a confidence interval for the reliability of each expert and filters out the one ( s ) whose estimated upper-bound confidence interval is below a threshold - which jointly optimizes expected accuracy ( mean ) and need to better estimate the expert 's accuracy ( variance ) . Our framework is flexible enough to work with a wide range of different noise levels and outperforms baselines such as asking all available experts and random expert selection . In particular , IEThresh achieves a given level of accuracy with less than half the queries issued by all-experts labeling and less than a third the queries required by random expert selection on datasets such as the UCI mushroom one . The results show that our method naturally balances exploration and exploitation as it gains knowledge of which experts to rely upon , and selects them with increasing frequency .", "11539451": "Neighbor query friendly compression of social networks .

Spatial analysis of disease risk , or disease mapping , typically relies on information about the residence and health status of individuals from population under study . However , residence information has its limitations because people are exposed to numerous disease risks as they spend time outside of their residences . Thanks to the wide-spread use of mobile phones and GPS-enabled devices , it is becoming possible to obtain a detailed record about the movement of human populations . Availability of movement information opens up an opportunity to improve the accuracy of disease mapping . Starting with an assumption that an individual 's disease risk is a weighted average of risks at the locations which were visited , we show that disease mapping can be accomplished by spatially regularized logistic regression . Due to the inherent sparsity of movement data , the proposed approach can be applied to large populations and over large spatial grids . In our experiments , we were able to map disease for a simulated population with 1.6 million people and a spatial grid with 65 thousand locations in several minutes . The results indicate that movement information can improve the accuracy of disease mapping as compared to residential data only . We also studied a privacy-preserving scenario in which only the aggregate statistics are available about the movement of the overall population , while detailed movement information is available only for individuals with disease .

Heterogeneous data co-clustering has attracted more and more attention in recent years due to its high impact on various applications . While the co-clustering algorithms for two types of heterogeneous data ( denoted by pair-wise co-clustering ) , such as documents and terms , have been well studied in the literature , the work on more types of heterogeneous data ( denoted by high-order co-clustering ) is still very limited .

Many criteria can be used to evaluate the performance of supervised learning . Different criteria are appropriate in different settings , and it is not always clear which criteria to use . A further complication is that learning methods that perform well on one criterion may not perform well on other criteria . For example , SVMs and boosting are designed to optimize accuracy , whereas neural nets typically optimize squared error or cross entropy . We conducted an empirical study using a variety of learning methods ( SVMs , neural nets , k-nearest neighbor , bagged and boosted trees , and boosted stumps ) to compare nine boolean classification performance metrics : Accuracy , Lift , F-Score , Area under the ROC Curve , Average Precision , Precision\\/Recall Break-Even Point , Squared Error , Cross Entropy , and Probability Calibration . Multidimensional scaling ( MDS ) shows that these metrics span a low dimensional manifold . The three metrics that are appropriate when predictions are interpreted as probabilities : squared error , cross entropy , and calibration , lay in one part of metric space far away from metrics that depend on the relative order of the predicted values : ROC area , average precision , break-even point , and lift . In between them fall two metrics that depend on comparing predictions to a threshold : accuracy and F-score . As expected , maximum margin methods such as SVMs and boosted trees have excellent performance on metrics like accuracy , but perform poorly on probability metrics such as squared error . What was not expected was that the margin methods have excellent performance on ordering metrics such as ROC area and average precision . We introduce a new metric , SAR , that combines squared error , accuracy , and ROC area into one metric . MDS and correlation analysis shows that SAR is centrally located and correlates well with other metrics , suggesting that it is a good general purpose metric to use when more specific criteria are not known .", "13693678": "Graphs over time : densification laws , shrinking diameters and possible explanations . How do real graphs evolve over time ? What are `` normal '' growth patterns in social , technological , and information networks ?

However , given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods , it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over time .

First , most of these graphs densify over time , with the number of edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes . Second , the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time , in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes ( like O ( log n ) or O ( log ( log n ) ) .

In this paper , we focus on mining surprising periodic patterns in a sequence of events . In many applications , e.g. , computational biology , an infrequent pattern is still considered very significant if its actual occurrence frequency exceeds the prior expectation by a large margin . The traditional metric , such as support , is not necessarily the ideal model to measure this kind of surprising patterns because it treats all patterns equally in the sense that every occurrence carries the same weight towards the assessment of the significance of a pattern regardless of the probability of occurrence . A more suitable measurement , information , is introduced to naturally value the degree of surprise of each occurrence of a pattern as a continuous and monotonically decreasing function of its probability of occurrence . This would allow patterns with vastly different occurrence probabilities to be handled seamlessly . As the accumulated degree of surprise of all repetitions of a pattern , the concept of information gain is proposed to measure the overall degree of surprise of the pattern within a data sequence .

String data has recently become important because of its use in a number of applications such as computational and molecular biology , protein analysis , and market basket data . In many cases , these strings contain a wide variety of substructures which may have physical significance for that application . For example , such substructures could represent important fragments of a DNA string or an interesting portion of a fraudulent transaction . In such a case , it is desirable to determine the identity , location , and extent of that substructure in the data . This is a much more difficult generalization of the classification problem , since the latter problem labels entire strings rather than deal with the more complex task of determining string fragments with a particular kind of behavior . The problem becomes even more complicated when different kinds of substrings show complicated nesting patterns . Therefore , we define a somewhat different problem which we refer to as the generalized classification problem . We propose a scalable approach based on hidden markov models for this problem . We show how to implement the generalized string classification procedure for very large data bases and data streams . We present experimental results over a number of large data sets and data streams .", "762867": "Query-time entity resolution .

We then show how it can be performed on-the-fly by adaptively extracting and resolving those database references that are the most helpful for resolving the query . We validate our approach on two large real-world publication databases where we show the usefulness of collective resolution and at the same time demonstrate the need for adaptive strategies for query processing .

Data mining in large collections of polyphonic music has recently received increasing interest by companies along with the advent of commercial online distribution of music . Important applications include the categorization of songs into genres and the recommendation of songs according to musical similarity and the customer 's musical preferences . Modeling genre or timbre of polyphonic music is at the core of these tasks and has been recognized as a difficult problem . Many audio features have been proposed , but they do not provide easily understandable descriptions of music . They do not explain why a genre was chosen or in which way one song is similar to another . We present an approach that combines large scale feature generation with meta learning techniques to obtain meaningful features for musical similarity . We perform exhaustive feature generation based on temporal statistics and train regression models to summarize a subset of these features into a single descriptor of a particular notion of music . Using several such models we produce a concise semantic description of each song . Genre classification models based on these semantic features are shown to be better understandable and almost as accurate as traditional methods .", "4532444": "Using randomized response techniques for privacy-preserving data mining .

The primary goal of Web usage mining is the discovery of patterns in the navigational behavior of Web users . Standard approaches , such as clustering of user sessions and discovering association rules or frequent navigational paths , do not generally provide the ability to automatically characterize or quantify the unobservable factors that lead to common navigational patterns . It is , therefore , necessary to develop techniques that can automatically discover hidden semantic relationships among users as well as between users and Web objects . Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis ( PLSA ) is particularly useful in this context , since it can uncover latent semantic associations among users and pages based on the co-occurrence patterns of these pages in user sessions . In this paper , we develop a unified framework for the discovery and analysis of Web navigational patterns based on PLSA . We show the flexibility of this framework in characterizing various relationships among users and Web objects . Since these relationships are measured in terms of probabilities , we are able to use probabilistic inference to perform a variety of analysis tasks such as user segmentation , page classification , as well as predictive tasks such as collaborative recommendations .

Given the open nature of social networking sites , is it possible to manage one 's privacy protection ? With the diversity of one 's social media friends , how can one figure out an effective approach to balance between vulnerability and privacy ? We present a novel way to define a vulnerable friend from an individual user 's perspective is dependent on whether or not the user 's friends ' privacy settings protect the friend and the individual 's network of friends ( which includes the user ) . As a single vulnerable friend in a user 's social network might place all friends at risk , we resort to experiments and observe how much security an individual user can improve by unfriending a vulnerable friend .

We present and discuss a new perspective for reasoning about social networking security . When a user accepts a new friend , the user should ensure that the new friend is not an increased security risk with the potential of negatively impacting the entire friend network .

Recently proposed quotient cube addressed this issue through a partitioning method that groups cube cells into equivalence partitions . Such an approach is not only useful for distributive aggregate functions such as SUM but can also be applied to the holistic aggregate functions like MEDIAN . Maintaining a data cube for holistic aggregation is a hard problem since its difficulty lies in the fact that history tuple values must be kept in order to compute the new aggregate when tuples are inserted or deleted . The quotient cube makes the problem harder since we also need to maintain the equivalence classes .

This paper considers the framework of the so-called `` market basket problem '' , in which a database of transactions is mined for the occurrence of unusually frequent item sets . In our case , `` unusually frequent '' involves estimates of the frequency of each item set divided by a baseline frequency computed as if items occurred independently . The focus is on obtaining reliable estimates of this measure of interestingness for all item sets , even item sets with relatively low frequencies . For example , in a medical database of patient histories , unusual item sets including the item `` patient death '' ( or other serious adverse event ) might hopefully be flagged with as few as 5 or 10 occurrences of the item set , it being unacceptable to require that item sets occur in as many as 0.1 % of millions of patient reports before the data mining algorithm detects a signal . Similar considerations apply in fraud detection applications . Thus we abandon the requirement that interesting item sets must contain a relatively large fixed minimal support , and adopt a criterion based on the results of fitting an empirical Bayes model to the item set counts . The model allows us to define a 95 % Bayesian lower confidence limit for the `` interestingness '' measure of every item set , whereupon the item sets can be ranked according to their empirical Bayes confidence limits . For item sets of size J ) 2 , we also distinguish between multi-item associations that can be explained by the observed J ( J-1 ) \\/ 2 pairwise associations , and item sets that are significantly more frequent than their pairwise associations would suggest . Such item sets can uncover complex or synergistic mechanisms generating multi-item associations .

By contrast , we adopt a data mining point of view by proposing criteria that search for interesting subsets of the data , as opposed to modeling all of the data equally well . The new criteria do not split based on a compromise between the left and the right bucket ; they effectively pick the more interesting bucket and ignore the other . As expected , the result is often a simpler characterization of interesting subsets of the data . Less expected is that the new criteria often yield whole trees that provide more interpretable data descriptions . Surprisingly , it is a `` flaw '' that works to their advantage : The new criteria have an increased tendency to accept splits near the boundaries of the predictor ranges . This so-called `` end-cut problem '' leads to the repeated peeling of small layers of data and results in very unbalanced but highly expressive and interpretable trees .", "9463669": "Composition attacks and auxiliary information in data privacy . Privacy is an increasingly important aspect of data publishing . Reasoning about privacy , however , is fraught with pitfalls . One of the most significant is the auxiliary information ( also called external knowledge , background knowledge , or side information ) that an adversary gleans from other channels such as the web , public records , or domain knowledge . This paper explores how one can reason about privacy in the face of rich , realistic sources of auxiliary information . Specifically , we investigate the effectiveness of current anonymization schemes in preserving privacy when multiple organizations independently release anonymized data about overlapping populations . 1 . We investigate composition attacks , in which an adversary uses independent anonymized releases to breach privacy . We explain why recently proposed models of limited auxiliary information fail to capture composition attacks . Our experiments demonstrate that even a simple instance of a composition attack can breach privacy in practice , for a large class of currently proposed techniques . The class includes k-anonymity and several recent variants . 2 . On a more positive note , certain randomization-based notions of privacy ( such as differential privacy ) provably resist composition attacks and , in fact , the use of arbitrary side information . This resistance enables `` stand-alone '' design of anonymization schemes , without the need for explicitly keeping track of other releases . We provide a precise formulation of this property , and prove that an important class of relaxations of differential privacy also satisfy the property .

Behavior that deviates from the learned normal model signals possible novel attacks . Our IDS is unique in two respects . First , it is nonstationary , modeling probabilities based on the time since the last event rather than on average rate . This prevents alarm floods . Second , the IDS learns protocol vocabularies ( at the data link through application layers ) in order to detect unknown attacks that attempt to exploit implementation errors in poorly tested features of the target software .

On the other hand , generative classifiers have no trouble in handling an arbitrary number of classes efficiently , and NB classifiers train much faster than SVMs owing to their extreme simplicity . In contrast , SVMs handle multi-class problems by learning redundant yes\\/no ( one-vs-others ) classifiers for each class , further worsening the performance gap . We propose a new technique for multi-way classification which exploits the accuracy of SVMs and the speed of NB classifiers . We first use a NB classifier to quickly compute a confusion matrix , which is used to reduce the number and complexity of the two-class SVMs that are built in the second stage . During testing , we first get the prediction of a NB classifier and use that to selectively apply only a subset of the two-class SVMs . On standard benchmarks , our algorithm is 3 to 6 times faster than SVMs and yet matches or even exceeds their accuracy .", "366857": "Constraint-driven clustering . Clustering methods can be either data-driven or need-driven . Data-driven methods intend to discover the true structure of the underlying data while need-driven methods aims at organizing the true structure to meet certain application requirements . Thus , need-driven ( e.g. constrained ) clustering is able to find more useful and actionable clusters in applications such as energy aware sensor networks , privacy preservation , and market segmentation . However , the existing methods of constrained clustering require users to provide the number of clusters , which is often unknown in advance , but has a crucial impact on the clustering result . In this paper , we argue that a more natural way to generate actionable clusters is to let the application-specific constraints decide the number of clusters . For this purpose , we introduce a novel cluster model , Constraint-Driven Clustering ( CDC ) , which finds an a priori unspecified number of compact clusters that satisfy all user-provided constraints . Two general types of constraints are considered , i.e. minimum significance constraints and minimum variance constraints , as well as combinations of these two types . We prove the NP-hardness of the CDC problem with different constraints . We propose a novel dynamic data structure , the CD-Tree , which organizes data points in leaf nodes such that each leaf node approximately satisfies the CDC constraints and minimizes the objective function . Based on CD-Trees , we develop an efficient algorithm to solve the new clustering problem .

From a scientific point of view , it can be used as a gold standard to evaluate the performance of heuristic constraint-based decision tree learners and to gain new insight in traditional decision tree learners . From the application point of view , it can be used to discover trees that can not be found by heuristic decision tree learners . The key idea behind our algorithm is that there is a relation between constraints on decision trees and constraints on itemsets . We show that optimal decision trees can be extracted from lattices of itemsets in linear time . We give several strategies to efficiently build these lattices .

An ensemble is a set of learned models that make decisions collectively . Although an ensemble is usually more accurate than a single learner , existing ensemble methods often tend to construct unnecessarily large ensembles , which increases the memory consumption and computational cost . Ensemble pruning tackles this problem by selecting a subset of ensemble members to form subensembles that are subject to less resource consumption and response time with accuracy that is similar to or better than the original ensemble . In this paper , we analyze the accuracy\\/diversity trade-off and prove that classifiers that are more accurate and make more predictions in the minority group are more important for subensemble construction . Based on the gained insights , a heuristic metric that considers both accuracy and diversity is proposed to explicitly evaluate each individual classifier 's contribution to the whole ensemble . By incorporating ensemble members in decreasing order of their contributions , subensembles are formed such that users can select the top $ p $ percent of ensemble members , depending on their resource availability and tolerable waiting time , for predictions .

Feature selection is an important task in order to achieve better generalizability in high dimensional learning , and structure learning of Markov random fields ( MRFs ) can automatically discover the inherent structures underlying complex data . Both problems can be cast as solving an l1-norm regularized parameter estimation problem . The existing Grafting method can avoid doing inference on dense graphs in structure learning by incrementally selecting new features . However , Grafting performs a greedy step to optimize over free parameters once new features are included . This greedy strategy results in low efficiency when parameter learning is itself non-trivial , such as in MRFs , in which parameter learning depends on an expensive subroutine to calculate gradients . The complexity of calculating gradients in MRFs is typically exponential to the size of maximal cliques . In this paper , we present a fast algorithm called Grafting-Light to solve the l1-norm regularized maximum likelihood estimation of MRFs for efficient feature selection and structure learning . Grafting-Light iteratively performs one-step of orthant-wise gradient descent over free parameters and selects new features . This lazy strategy is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum and can effectively select significant features .

On the basis of SmartSifter this paper yields a new framework for outlier filtering using both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques iteratively in order to make the detection process more effective and more understandable . The outline of the framework is as follows : In the first round , for an initial dataset , we run SmartSifter to give each data a score , with a high score indicating a high possibility of being an outlier . Next , giving positive labels to a number of higher scored data and negative labels to a number of lower scored data , we create labeled examples . Then we construct an outlier filtering rule by supervised learning from them . Here the rule is generated based on the principle of minimizing extended stochastic complexity . In the second round , for a new dataset , we filter the data using the constructed rule , then among the filtered data , we run SmartSifter again to evaluate the data in order to update the filtering rule . Applying of our framework to the network intrusion detection , we demonstrate that 1 ) it can significantly improve the accuracy of SmartSifter , and 2 ) outlier filtering rules can help the user to discover a general pattern of an outlier group .", "4178805": "Dimension induced clustering .

This work showed yet again that empirical risk minimization ( ERM ) was the best method to find the next instance to label and provided an efficient way to compute ERM with the semi-supervised classifier .

Max-margin Markov networks ( M3N ) have shown great promise in structured prediction and relational learning . Due to the KKT conditions , the M3N enjoys dual sparsity . However , the existing M3N formulation does not enjoy primal sparsity , which is a desirable property for selecting significant features and reducing the risk of over-fitting . In this paper , we present an l1-norm regularized max-margin Markov network ( l1-M3N ) , which enjoys dual and primal sparsity simultaneously . To learn an l1-M3N , we present three methods including projected sub-gradient , cutting-plane , and a novel EM-style algorithm , which is based on an equivalence between l1-M3N and an adaptive M3N . We perform extensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real data sets . Our experimental results show that : ( 1 ) l1-M3N can effectively select significant features ; ( 2 ) l1-M3N can perform as well as the pseudo-primal sparse Laplace M3N in prediction accuracy , while consistently outperforms other competing methods that enjoy either primal or dual sparsity ; and ( 3 ) the EM-algorithm is more robust than the other two in pre-diction accuracy and time efficiency .", "55904": "XRules : an effective structural classifier for XML data .

Detecting outliers in a large set of data objects is a major data mining task aiming at finding different mechanisms responsible for different groups of objects in a data set .

This way , the effects of the `` curse of dimensionality '' are alleviated compared to purely distance-based approaches . A main advantage of our new approach is that our method does not rely on any parameter selection influencing the quality of the achieved ranking .

These models , however , do not take into account the manifold structure of data , which is generally informative for the non-linear dimensionality reduction mapping . More recent models , namely Laplacian PLSI ( LapPLSI ) and Locally-consistent Topic Model ( LTM ) , have incorporated the local manifold structure into topic models and have shown the resulting benefits . But these approaches fall short of the full discriminating power of manifold learning as they only enhance the proximity between the low-rank representations of neighboring pairs without any consideration for non-neighboring pairs .

In this paper , we consider a general framework for extracting shared structures in multi-label classification . In this framework , a common subspace is assumed to be shared among multiple labels . We show that the optimal solution to the proposed formulation can be obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem , though the problem is non-convex . For high-dimensional problems , direct computation of the solution is expensive , and we develop an efficient algorithm for this case .

Previous work on text mining has almost exclusively focused on a single stream .

In general , mining correlated bursty topic patterns from coordinated text streams can reveal interesting latent associations or events behind these streams .

We propose a general probabilistic algorithm which can effectively discover correlated bursty patterns and their bursty periods across text streams even if the streams have completely different vocabularies ( e.g. , English vs Chinese ) . Evaluation of the proposed method on a news data set and a literature data set shows that it can effectively discover quite meaningful topic patterns from both data sets : the patterns discovered from the news data set accurately reveal the major common events covered in the two streams of news articles ( in English and Chinese , respectively ) , while the patterns discovered from two database publication streams match well with the major research paradigm shifts in database research .

This is achieved through our main technical contribution which provides a framework based on the log-determinant matrix divergence which enables efficient optimization of structured , low-parameter Mahalanobis distances . Experimentally , we evaluate our methods across a variety of high dimensional domains , including text , statistical software analysis , and collaborative filtering , showing that our methods scale to data sets with tens of thousands or more features . We show that our learned metric can achieve excellent quality with respect to various criteria . For example , in the context of metric learning for nearest neighbor classification , we show that our methods achieve 24 % higher accuracy over the baseline distance . Additionally , our methods yield very good precision while providing recall measures up to 20 % higher than other baseline methods such as latent semantic analysis .", "10017791": "Learning optimal ranking with tensor factorization for tag recommendation . Tag recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized list of tags for a user given an item . This is important for many websites with tagging capabilities like last . fm or delicious . In this paper , we propose a method for tag recommendation based on tensor factorization ( TF ) . In contrast to other TF methods like higher order singular value decomposition ( HOSVD ) , our method RTF ( ` ranking with tensor factorization ' ) directly optimizes the factorization model for the best personalized ranking . RTF handles missing values and learns from pairwise ranking constraints . Our optimization criterion for TF is motivated by a detailed analysis of the problem and of interpretation schemes for the observed data in tagging systems . In all , RTF directly optimizes for the actual problem using a correct interpretation of the data . We provide a gradient descent algorithm to solve our optimization problem . We also provide an improved learning and prediction method with runtime complexity analysis for RTF . The prediction runtime of RTF is independent of the number of observations and only depends on the factorization dimensions . Besides the theoretical analysis , we empirically show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art tag recommendation methods like FolkRank , PageRank and HOSVD both in quality and prediction runtime .", "9194903": "Combinational collaborative filtering for personalized community recommendation .

Not only is Wikipedia a comprehensive source of quality information , it has several kinds of internal structure ( e.g. , relational summaries known as infoboxes ) , which enable self-supervised information extraction . While previous efforts at extraction from Wikipedia achieve high precision and recall on well-populated classes of articles , they fail in a larger number of cases , largely because incomplete articles and infrequent use of infoboxes lead to insufficient training data . This paper presents three novel techniques for increasing recall from Wikipedia 's long tail of sparse classes : ( 1 ) shrinkage over an automatically-learned subsumption taxonomy , ( 2 ) a retraining technique for improving the training data , and ( 3 ) supplementing results by extracting from the broader Web . Our experiments compare design variations and show that , used in concert , these techniques increase recall by a factor of 1.76 to 8.71 while maintaining or increasing precision .", "4739043": "Predicting prostate cancer recurrence via maximizing the concordance index . In order to effectively use machine learning algorithms , e.g. , neural networks , for the analysis of survival data , the correct treatment of censored data is crucial . The concordance index ( CI ) is a typical metric for quantifying the predictive ability of a survival model . We propose a new algorithm that directly uses the CI as the objective function to train a model , which predicts whether an event will eventually occur or not . Directly optimizing the CI allows the model to make complete use of the information from both censored and non-censored observations . In particular , we approximate the CI via a differentiable function so that gradient-based methods can be used to train the model . We applied the new algorithm to predict the eventual recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy .

Various constrained frequent pattern mining problem formulations and associated algorithms have been developed that enable the user to specify various itemset-based constraints that better capture the underlying application requirements and characteristics . In this paper we introduce a new class of block constraints that determine the significance of an itemset pattern by considering the dense block that is formed by the pattern 's items and its associated set of transactions . Block constraints provide a natural framework by which a number of important problems can be specified and make it possible to solve numerous problems on binary and real-valued datasets . However , developing computationally efficient algorithms to find these block constraints poses a number of challenges as unlike the different itemset-based constraints studied earlier , these block constraints are tough as they are neither anti-monotone , monotone , nor convertible . To overcome this problem , we introduce a new class of pruning methods that significantly reduce the overall search space and present a computationally efficient and scalable algorithm called CBMiner to find the closed itemsets that satisfy the block constraints .", "8604501": "Tumor cell identification using features rules . Advances in imaging techniques have led to large repositories of images . There is an increasing demand for automated systems that can analyze complex medical images and extract meaningful information for mining patterns . Here , we describe a real-life image mining application to the problem of tumor cell counting . The quantitative analysis of tumor cells is fundamental to characterizing the activity of tumor cells . Existing approaches are mostly manual , time-consuming and subjective . Efforts to automate the process of cell counting have largely focused on using image processing techniques only .

Even though human movement and mobility patterns have a high degree of freedom and variation , they also exhibit structural patterns due to geographic and social constraints . Using cell phone location data , as well as data from two online location-based social networks , we aim to understand what basic laws govern human motion and dynamics . We find that humans experience a combination of periodic movement that is geographically limited and seemingly random jumps correlated with their social networks . Short-ranged travel is periodic both spatially and temporally and not effected by the social network structure , while long-distance travel is more influenced by social network ties . We show that social relationships can explain about 10 % to 30 % of all human movement , while periodic behavior explains 50 % to 70 % . Based on our findings , we develop a model of human mobility that combines periodic short range movements with travel due to the social network structure . We show that our model reliably predicts the locations and dynamics of future human movement and gives an order of magnitude better performance than present models of human mobility .", "10837032": "Pervasive parallelism in data mining : dataflow solution to co-clustering large and sparse Netflix data . All Netflix Prize algorithms proposed so far are prohibitively costly for large-scale production systems . In this paper , we describe an efficient dataflow implementation of a collaborative filtering ( CF ) solution to the Netflix Prize problem ( 1 ) based on weighted coclustering ( 5 ) . The dataflow library we use facilitates the development of sophisticated parallel programs designed to fully utilize commodity multicore hardware , while hiding traditional difficulties such as queuing , threading , memory management , and deadlocks . The dataflow CF implementation first compresses the large , sparse training dataset into co-clusters . Then it generates recommendations by combining the average ratings of the co-clusters with the biases of the users and movies . When configured to identify 20x20 co-clusters in the Netflix training dataset , the implementation predicted over 100 million ratings in 16.31 minutes and achieved an RMSE of 0.88846 without any fine-tuning or domain knowledge . This is an effective real-time prediction runtime of 9.7 us per rating which is far superior to previously reported results . Moreover , the implemented co-clustering framework supports a wide variety of other large-scale data mining applications and forms the basis for predictive modeling on large , dyadic datasets ( 4 , 7 ) .", "323500": "Towards automated synthesis of data mining programs .", "959718": "Collaborative crawling : mining user experiences for topical resource discovery . The rapid growth of the world wide web had made the problem of topic specific resource discovery an important one in recent years . In this problem , it is desired to find web pages which satisfy a predicate specified by the user . Such a predicate could be a keyword query , a topical query , or some arbitrary contraint . Several techniques such as focussed crawling and intelligent crawling have recently been proposed for topic specific resource discovery . All these crawlers are linkage based , since they use the hyperlink behavior in order to perform resource discovery . Recent studies have shown that the topical correlations in hyperlinks are quite noisy and may not always show the consistency necessary for a reliable resource discovery process . In this paper , we will approach the problem of resource discovery from an entirely different perspective ; we will mine the significant browsing patterns of world wide web users in order to model the likelihood of web pages belonging to a specified predicate . This user behavior can be mined from the freely available traces of large public domain proxies on the world wide web . We refer to this technique as collaborative crawling because it mines the collective user experiences in order to find topical resources . Such a strategy is extremely effective because the topical consistency in world wide web browsing patterns turns out to very reliable . In addition , the user-centered crawling system can be combined with linkage based systems to create an overall system which works more effectively than a system based purely on either user behavior or hyperlinks .", "1317160": "A model for discovering customer value for E-content . There exists a huge demand for multimedia goods and services in the Internet . Currently available bandwidth speeds can support sale of downloadable content like CDs , e-books , etc. as well as services like video-on-demand .

The goal of clustering is to identify distinct groups in a dataset . The basic idea of model-based clustering is to approximate the data density by a mixture model , typically a mixture of Gaussians , and to estimate the parameters of the component densities , the mixing fractions , and the number of components from the data . The number of distinct groups in the data is then taken to be the number of mixture components , and the observations are partitioned into clusters ( estimates of the groups ) using Bayes ' rule . If the groups are well separated and look Gaussian , then the resulting clusters will indeed tend to be `` distinct '' in the most common sense of the word - contiguous , densely populated areas of feature space , separated by contiguous , relatively empty regions . If the groups are not Gaussian , however , this correspondence may break down ; an isolated group with a non-elliptical distribution , for example , may be modeled by not one , but several mixture components , and the corresponding clusters will no longer be well separated . We present methods for assessing the degree of separation between the components of a mixture model and between the corresponding clusters . We also propose a new clustering method that can be regarded as a hybrid between model-based and nonparametric clustering . The hybrid clustering algorithm prunes the cluster tree generated by hierarchical model-based clustering . Starting with the tree corresponding to the mixture model chosen by the Bayesian Information Criterion , it progressively merges clusters that do not appear to correspond to different modes of the data density .", "4584686": "Characterising the difference .

This kind of methods rely on the statistics principle of t-test , which requires that the data follows a normal distribution .

Moreover , we propose using the significance level threshold , instead of the number of informative genes , as the parameter . The significance level threshold as a parameter carries the quality specification in statistics . We follow the Pitman efficiency theory to show that the rank sum method is more accurate and more robust than the t-statistic method in theory . To verify the effectiveness of the rank sum method , we use support vector machine ( SVM ) to construct classifiers based on the identified informative genes on two well known data sets , namely colon data and leukemia data . The prediction accuracy reaches 96.2 % on the colon data and 100 % on the leukemia data . The results are clearly better than those from the previous feature ranking methods .

The discovery of biclusters , which denote groups of items that show coherent values across a subset of all the transactions in a data set , is an important type of analysis performed on real-valued data sets in various domains , such as biology . Several algorithms have been proposed to find different types of biclusters in such data sets . However , these algorithms are unable to search the space of all possible biclusters exhaustively . Pattern mining algorithms in association analysis also essentially produce biclusters as their result , since the patterns consist of items that are supported by a subset of all the transactions . However , a major limitation of the numerous techniques developed in association analysis is that they are only able to analyze data sets with binary and\\/or categorical variables , and their application to real-valued data sets often involves some lossy transformation such as discretization or binarization of the attributes . In this paper , we propose a novel association analysis framework for exhaustively and efficiently mining `` range support '' patterns from such a data set . On one hand , this framework reduces the loss of information incurred by the binarization - and discretization-based approaches , and on the other , it enables the exhaustive discovery of coherent biclusters .

To analyze the effect of the oceans and atmosphere on land climate , Earth Scientists have developed climate indices , which are time series that summarize the behavior of selected regions of the Earth 's oceans and atmosphere .

The centroids of these clusters are time series that summarize the behavior of the ocean or atmosphere in those regions . Some of these centroids correspond to known climate indices and provide a validation of our methodology ; other centroids are variants of known indices that may provide better predictive power for some land areas ; and still other indices may represent potentially new Earth science phenomena .

Viewpoint patterns refer to patterns that capture the invariant relationships of one object from the point of view of another object . These patterns are unique and significant in images because the absolute positional information of objects for most images is not important , but rather , it is the relative distance and orientation of the objects from each other that is meaningful . We design a scalable and efficient algorithm to discover such viewpoint patterns . Experiments results on various image sets demonstrate that viewpoint patterns are meaningful and interesting to human users .", "9714416": "The cost of privacy : destruction of data-mining utility in anonymized data publishing . Re-identification is a major privacy threat to public datasets containing individual records . Many privacy protection algorithms rely on generalization and suppression of `` quasi-identifier '' attributes such as ZIP code and birthdate . Their objective is usually syntactic sanitization : for example , k-anonymity requires that each `` quasi-identifier '' tuple appear in at least k records , while l-diversity requires that the distribution of sensitive attributes for each quasi-identifier have high entropy . The utility of sanitized data is also measured syntactically , by the number of generalization steps applied or the number of records with the same quasi-identifier . In this paper , we ask whether generalization and suppression of quasi-identifiers offer any benefits over trivial sanitization which simply separates quasi-identifiers from sensitive attributes . Previous work showed that k-anonymous databases can be useful for data mining , but k-anonymization does not guarantee any privacy . By contrast , we measure the tradeoff between privacy ( how much can the adversary learn from the sanitized records ? ) and utility , measured as accuracy of data-mining algorithms executed on the same sanitized records . For our experimental evaluation , we use the same datasets from the UCI machine learning repository as were used in previous research on generalization and suppression . Our results demonstrate that even modest privacy gains require almost complete destruction of the data-mining utility . In most cases , trivial sanitization provides equivalent utility and better privacy than k-anonymity , l-diversity , and similar methods based on generalization and suppression .", "11804378": "A general framework for accurate and fast regression by data summarization in random decision trees . Predicting the values of continuous variable as a function of several independent variables is one of the most important problems for data mining . A very large number of regression methods , both parametric and nonparametric , have been proposed in the past . However , since the list is quite extensive and many of these models make rather explicit , strong yet different assumptions about the type of applicable problems and involve a lot of parameters and options , choosing the appropriate regression methodology and then specifying the parameter values is a none-trivial , sometimes frustrating , task for data mining practitioners . Choosing the inappropriate methodology can have rather disappointing results . This issue is against the general utility of data mining software . For example , linear regression methods are straightforward and well-understood . However , since the linear assumption is very strong , its performance is compromised for complicated non-linear problems . Kernel-based methods perform quite well if the kernel functions are selected correctly . In this paper , we propose a straightforward approach based on summarizing the training data using an ensemble of random decisions trees . It requires very little knowledge from the user , yet is applicable to every type of regression problem that we are currently aware of . We have experimented on a wide range of problems including those that parametric methods performwell , a large selection of benchmark datasets for nonparametric regression , as well as highly non-linear stochastic problems .

Most traditional supervised learning methods are developed to learn a model from labeled examples and use this model to classify the unlabeled ones into the same label space predefined by the models . However , in many real world applications , the label spaces for both the labeled\\/training and unlabeled\\/testing examples can be different . To solve this problem , this paper proposes a novel notion of Serendipitous Learning ( SL ) , which is defined to address the learning scenarios in which the label space can be enlarged during the testing phase . In particular , a large margin approach is proposed to solve SL . The basic idea is to leverage the knowledge in the labeled examples to help identify novel\\/unknown classes , and the large margin formulation is proposed to incorporate both the classification loss on the examples within the known categories , as well as the clustering loss on the examples in unknown categories . An efficient optimization algorithm based on CCCP and the bundle method is proposed to solve the optimization problem of the large margin formulation of SL . Moreover , an efficient online learning method is proposed to address the issue of large scale data in online learning scenario , which has been shown to have a guaranteed learning regret . An extensive set of experimental results on two synthetic datasets and two datasets from real world applications demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over several other baseline algorithms . One limitation of the proposed method is that the number of unknown classes is given in advance . It may be possible to remove this constraint if we model it by using a non-parametric way .

We examine the improvement ( or lack thereof ) in data quality via repeated labeling , and focus especially on the improvement of training labels for supervised induction . With the outsourcing of small tasks becoming easier , for example via Rent-A-Coder or Amazon 's Mechanical Turk , it often is possible to obtain less-than-expert labeling at low cost . With low-cost labeling , preparing the unlabeled part of the data can become considerably more expensive than labeling . We present repeated-labeling strategies of increasing complexity , and show several main results . ( i ) Repeated-labeling can improve label quality and model quality , but not always . ( ii ) When labels are noisy , repeated labeling can be preferable to single labeling even in the traditional setting where labels are not particularly cheap . ( iii ) As soon as the cost of processing the unlabeled data is not free , even the simple strategy of labeling everything multiple times can give considerable advantage . ( iv ) Repeatedly labeling a carefully chosen set of points is generally preferable , and we present a robust technique that combines different notions of uncertainty to select data points for which quality should be improved .

In this work , we address the problem of joint modeling of text and citations in the topic modeling framework .

The Pairwise-Link-LDA model combines the ideas of LDA ( 4 ) and Mixed Membership Block Stochastic Models ( 1 ) and allows modeling arbitrary link structure . However , the model is computationally expensive , since it involves modeling the presence or absence of a citation ( link ) between every pair of documents . The second model solves this problem by assuming that the link structure is a bipartite graph . As the name indicates , Link-PLSA-LDA model combines the LDA and PLSA models into a single graphical model . Our experiments on a subset of Citeseer data show that both these models are able to predict unseen data better than the baseline model of Erosheva and Lafferty ( 8 ) , by capturing the notion of topical similarity between the contents of the cited and citing documents . Our experiments on two different data sets on the link prediction task show that the Link-PLSA-LDA model performs the best on the citation prediction task , while also remaining highly scalable .

Knowing the reputations of your own and\\/or competitors ' products is important for marketing and customer relationship management . It is , however , very costly to collect and analyze survey data manually . This paper presents a new framework for mining product reputations on the Internet . It automatically collects people 's opinions about target products from Web pages , and it uses text mining techniques to obtain the reputations of those products . On the basis of human-test samples , we generate in advance syntactic and linguistic rules to determine whether any given statement is an opinion or not , as well as whether such any opinion is positive or negative in nature . We first collect statements regarding target products using a general search engine , and then , using the rules , extract opinions from among them and attach three labels to each opinion , labels indicating the positive\\/negative determination , the product name itself , and an numerical value expressing the degree of system confidence that the statement is , in fact , an opinion . The labeled opinions are then input into an opinion database . The mining of reputations , i.e. , the finding of statistically meaningful information included in the database , is then conducted . We specify target categories using label values ( such as positive opinions of product A ) and perform four types of text mining : extraction of 1 ) characteristic words , 2 ) co-occurrence words , 3 ) typical sentences , for individual target categories , and 4 ) correspondence analysis among multiple target categories . Actual marketing data is used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the framework , which offers a drastic reduction in the overall cost of reputation analysis over that of conventional survey approaches and supports the discovery of knowledge from the pool of opinions on the web .", "1167595": "Eigenspace-based anomaly detection in computer systems . We report on an automated runtime anomaly detection method at the application layer of multi-node computer systems .

We model a Web-based system as a weighted graph , where each node represents a `` service '' and each edge represents a dependency between services . Since the edge weights vary greatly over time , the problem we address is that of anomaly detection from a time sequence of graphs . In our method , we first extract a feature vector from the adjacency matrix that represents the activities of all of the services . The heart of our method is to use the principal eigenvector of the eigenclusters of the graph . Then we derive a probability distribution for an anomaly measure defined for a time-series of directional data derived from the graph sequence .

Essentially all data mining algorithms assume that the data-generating process is independent of the data miner 's activities . However , in many domains , including spam detection , intrusion detection , fraud detection , surveillance and counter-terrorism , this is far from the case : the data is actively manipulated by an adversary seeking to make the classifier produce false negatives . In these domains , the performance of a classifier can degrade rapidly after it is deployed , as the adversary learns to defeat it . Currently the only solution to this is repeated , manual , ad hoc reconstruction of the classifier . In this paper we develop a formal framework and algorithms for this problem . We view classification as a game between the classifier and the adversary , and produce a classifier that is optimal given the adversary 's optimal strategy . Experiments in a spam detection domain show that this approach can greatly outperform a classifier learned in the standard way , and ( within the parameters of the problem ) automatically adapt the classifier to the adversary 's evolving manipulations .", "5169771": "Detecting time series motifs under uniform scaling .

In this paper , we propose a new algorithm that mines only maximal frequent subgraphs , i.e. subgraphs that are not a part of any other frequent subgraphs . This may exponentially decrease the size of the output set in the best case ; in our experiments on practical data sets , mining maximal frequent subgraphs reduces the total number of mined patterns by two to three orders of magnitude . Our method first mines all frequent trees from a general graph database and then reconstructs all maximal subgraphs from the mined trees .

Therefore , itemsets within an equivalence class all share the same level of statistical significance regardless of the variety of test statistics . As an equivalence class can be uniquely determined and concisely represented by a closed pattern and a set of generators , we just mine closed patterns and generators , taking a simultaneous depth-first search scheme . This parallel approach has not been exploited by any prior work . We evaluate our algorithm on two aspects . In general , we compare to LCM and FPclose which are the best algorithms tailored for mining only closed patterns . In particular , we compare to epMiner which is the most recent algorithm for mining a type of relative risk patterns , known as minimal emerging patterns . Experimental results show that our algorithm is faster than all of them , sometimes even multiple orders of magnitude faster . These statistically ranked patterns and the efficiency have a high potential for real-life applications , especially in biomedical and financial fields where classical test statistics are of dominant interest .", "5097759": "Canonicalization of database records using adaptive similarity measures . It is becoming increasingly common to construct databases from information automatically culled from many heterogeneous sources . For example , a research publication database can be constructed by automatically extracting titles , authors , and conference information from online papers . A common difficulty in consolidating data from multiple sources is that records are referenced in a variety of ways ( e.g. abbreviations , aliases , and misspellings ) . Therefore , it can be difficult to construct a single , standard representation to present to the user . We refer to the task of constructing this representation as canonicalization . Despite its importance , there is little existing work on canonicalization . In this paper , we explore the use of edit distance measures to construct a canonical representation that is `` central '' in the sense that it is most similar to each of the disparate records . This approach reduces the impact of noisy records on the canonical representation . Furthermore , because the user may prefer different styles of canonicalization , we show how different edit distance costs can result in different forms of canonicalization . For example , reducing the cost of character deletions can result in representations that favor abbreviated forms over expanded forms ( e.g. KDD versus Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining ) . We describe how to learn these costs from a small amount of manually annotated data using stochastic hill-climbing . Additionally , we investigate feature-based methods to learn ranking preferences over canonicalizations . These approaches can incorporate arbitrary textual evidence to select a canonical record . We evaluate our approach on a real-world publications database and show that our learning method results in a canonicalization solution that is robust to errors and easily customizable to user preferences .", "529092": "Density-based indexing for approximate nearest-neighbor queries .", "76938": "MARK : a boosting algorithm for heterogeneous kernel models . Support Vector Machines and other kernel methods have proven to be very effective for nonlinear inference . Practical issues are how to select the type of kernel including any parameters and how to deal with the computational issues caused by the fact that the kernel matrix grows quadratically with the data . Inspired by ensemble and boosting methods like MART , we propose the Multiple Additive Regression Kernels ( MARK ) algorithm to address these issues . MARK considers a large ( potentially infinite ) library of kernel matrices formed by different kernel functions and parameters . Using gradient boosting\\/column generation , MARK constructs columns of the heterogeneous kernel matrix ( the base hypotheses ) on the fly and then adds them into the kernel ensemble . Regularization methods such as used in SVM , kernel ridge regression , and MART , are used to prevent overfitting . We investigate how MARK is applied to heterogeneous kernel ridge regression . The resulting algorithm is simple to implement and efficient . Kernel parameter selection is handled within MARK . Sampling and `` weak '' kernels are used to further enhance the computational efficiency of the resulting additive algorithm . The user can incorporate and potentially extract domain knowledge by restricting the kernel library to interpretable kernels . MARK compares very favorably with SVM and kernel ridge regression on several benchmark datasets .", "5210404": "Wavelet synopsis for data streams : minimizing non-euclidean error . We consider the wavelet synopsis construction problem for data streams where given n numbers we wish to estimate the data by constructing a synopsis , whose size , say B is much smaller than n. The B numbers are chosen to minimize a suitable error between the original data and the estimate derived from the synopsis . Several good one-pass wavelet construction streaming algorithms minimizing the l2 error exist . For other error measures , the problem is less understood . We provide the first one-pass small space streaming algorithms with provable error guarantees ( additive approximation ) for minimizing a variety of non-Euclidean error measures including all weighted lp ( including l \u221e ) and relative error lp metrics . In several previous works solutions ( for weighted l2 , l \u221e and maximum relative error ) where the B synopsis coefficients are restricted to be wavelet coefficients of the data were proposed . This restriction yields suboptimal solutions on even fairly simple examples . Other lines of research , such as probabilistic synopsis , imposed restrictions on how the synopsis was arrived at . To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first paper to address the general problem , without any restriction on how the synopsis is arrived at , as well as provide the first streaming algorithms with guaranteed performance for these classes of error measures .", "9135542": "Mobile call graphs : beyond power-law and lognormal distributions .

We find that these distributions are skewed , and that they significantly deviate from what would be expected by power-law and lognormal distributions . To analyze our observed distributions ( of number of calls , distinct call partners , and total talk time ) , we propose PowerTrack , a method which fits a lesser known but more suitable distribution , namely the Double Pareto LogNormal ( DPLN ) distribution , to our data and track its parameters over time . Using PowerTrack , we find that our graph changes over time in a way consistent with a generative process that naturally results in the DPLN distributions we observe . Furthermore , we show that this generative process lends itself to a natural and appealing social wealth interpretation in the context of social networks such as ours . We discuss the application of those results to our model and to forecasting .", "11109637": "An efficient algorithm for a class of fused lasso problems . The fused Lasso penalty enforces sparsity in both the coefficients and their successive differences , which is desirable for applications with features ordered in some meaningful way .

Existing algorithms have high computational complexity and do not scale to large-size problems . In this paper , we propose an Efficient Fused Lasso Algorithm ( EFLA ) for optimizing this class of problems . One key building block in the proposed EFLA is the Fused Lasso Signal Approximator ( FLSA ) . To efficiently solve FLSA , we propose to reformulate it as the problem of finding an `` appropriate '' subgradient of the fused penalty at the minimizer , and develop a Subgradient Finding Algorithm ( SFA ) . We further design a restart technique to accelerate the convergence of SFA , by exploiting the special `` structures '' of both the original and the reformulated FLSA problems . Our empirical evaluations show that , both SFA and EFLA significantly outperform existing solvers . We also demonstrate several applications of the fused Lasso .", "980270": "A parallel learning algorithm for text classification .

However , its computational cost is quadratic in the number of items to be clustered , and it is therefore not applicable to large problems . We review an idea called Fractionation , originally conceived by Cutting , Karger , Pedersen and Tukey for non-parametric hierarchical clustering of large datasets , and describe an adaptation of Fractionation to model-based clustering . A further extension , called Refractionation , leads to a procedure that can be successful even in the difficult situation where there are large numbers of small groups .", "4657809": "Playing hide-and-seek with correlations .

Instead , the correlations become more obvious to the user , because they are hidden in a much smaller portion of the database . This process can be repeated iteratively and interactively , until only the most important correlations remain .

Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) techniques revolutionized statistical practice in the 1990s by providing an essential toolkit for making the rigor and flexibility of Bayesian analysis computationally practical . At the same time the increasing prevalence of massive datasets and the expansion of the field of data mining has created the need to produce statistically sound methods that scale to these large problems . Except for the most trivial examples , current MCMC methods require a complete scan of the dataset for each iteration eliminating their candidacy as feasible data mining techniques . In this article we present a method for making Bayesian analysis of massive datasets computationally feasible . The algorithm simulates from a posterior distribution that conditions on a smaller , more manageable portion of the dataset . The remainder of the dataset may be incorporated by reweighting the initial draws using importance sampling . Computation of the importance weights requires a single scan of the remaining observations . While importance sampling increases efficiency in data access , it comes at the expense of estimation efficiency . A simple modification , based on the `` rejuvenation '' step used in particle filters for dynamic systems models , sidesteps the loss of efficiency with only a slight increase in the number of data accesses . To show proof-of-concept , we demonstrate the method on a mixture of transition models that has been used to model web traffic and robotics .

Sequential pattern discovery is a well-studied field in data mining . Episodes are sequential patterns describing events that often occur in the vicinity of each other .

Most of the research on episodes deals with special cases such as serial , parallel , and injective episodes , while discovering general episodes is understudied . In this paper we extend the definition of an episode in order to be able to represent cases where events often occur simultaneously . We present an efficient and novel miner for discovering frequent and closed general episodes . Such a task presents unique challenges . Firstly , we can not define closure based on frequency . We solve this by computing a more conservative closure that we use to reduce the search space and discover the closed episodes as a postprocessing step . Secondly , episodes are traditionally presented as directed acyclic graphs . We argue that this representation has drawbacks leading to redundancy in the output . We solve these drawbacks by defining a subset relationship in such a way that allows us to remove the redundant episodes .

One goal of the analysis is to extract a subset of the samples and a subset of the genes , such that the expression levels of the chosen genes behave similarly across the subset of the samples , presumably reflecting an underlying regulatory mechanism governing the expression level of the genes . We propose to base the similarity of the genes in a coCluster on a simple biological model , in which the strength of the regulatory mechanism in sample j is Hj , and the response strength of gene i to the regulatory mechanism is Gi . In other words , every two genes participating in a good coCluster should have expression values in each of the participating samples , whose ratio is a constant depending only on the two genes . Noise in the expression levels of genes is taken into account by allowing a deviation from the model , measured by a relative error criterion .

It has been shown that support can be misleading as an indicator of how interesting the rule is . Alternative measures , such as lift , have been proposed .

To achieve collusion resistance , previously proposed protocols for anonymity-preserving data collection have quadratically many communication rounds in the number of respondents , and employ ( sometimes incorrectly ) complicated cryptographic techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs .

In this paper , we propose a unified generative model for LARA , which does not need pre-specified aspect keywords and simultaneously mines 1 ) latent topical aspects , 2 ) ratings on each identified aspect , and 3 ) weights placed on different aspects by a reviewer . Experiment results on two different review data sets demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively perform the Latent Aspect Rating Analysis task without the supervision of aspect keywords . Because of its generality , the proposed model can be applied to explore all kinds of opinionated text data containing overall sentiment judgments and support a wide range of interesting application tasks , such as aspect-based opinion summarization , personalized entity ranking and recommendation , and reviewer behavior analysis .", "998449": "Combining email models for false positive reduction . Machine learning and data mining can be effectively used to model , classify and discover interesting information for a wide variety of data including email . The Email Mining Toolkit , EMT , has been designed to provide a wide range of analyses for arbitrary email sources . Depending upon the task , one can usually achieve very high accuracy , but with some amount of false positive tradeoff . Generally false positives are prohibitively expensive in the real world . In the case of spam detection , for example , even if one email is misclassified , this may be unacceptable if it is a very important email . Much work has been done to improve specific algorithms for the task of detecting unwanted messages , but less work has been report on leveraging multiple algorithms and correlating models in this particular domain of email analysis . EMT has been updated with new correlation functions allowing the analyst to integrate a number of EMT 's user behavior models available in the core technology . We present results of combining classifier outputs for improving both accuracy and reducing false positives for the problem of spam detection . We apply these methods to a very large email data set and show results of different combination methods on these corpora . We introduce a new method to compare multiple and combined classifiers , and show how it differs from past work . The method analyzes the relative gain and maximum possible accuracy that can be achieved for certain combinations of classifiers to automatically choose the best combination .", "10095848": "Effective label acquisition for collective classification . Information diffusion , viral marketing , and collective classification all attempt to model and exploit the relationships in a network to make inferences about the labels of nodes . A variety of techniques have been introduced and methods that combine attribute information and neighboring label information have been shown to be effective for collective labeling of the nodes in a network . However , in part because of the correlation between node labels that the techniques exploit , it is easy to find cases in which , once a misclassification is made , incorrect information propagates throughout the network . This problem can be mitigated if the system is allowed to judiciously acquire the labels for a small number of nodes . Unfortunately , under relatively general assumptions , determining the optimal set of labels to acquire is intractable . Here we propose an acquisition method that learns the cases when a given collective classification algorithm makes mistakes , and suggests acquisitions to correct those mistakes . We empirically show on both real and synthetic datasets that this method significantly outperforms a greedy approximate inference approach , a viral marketing approach , and approaches based on network structural measures such as node degree and network clustering . In addition to significantly improving accuracy with just a small amount of labeled data , our method is tractable on large networks .", "8613999": "Predicting rare classes : can boosting make any weak learner strong ? . Boosting is a strong ensemble-based learning algorithm with the promise of iteratively improving the classification accuracy using any base learner , as long as it satisfies the condition of yielding weighted accuracy ) 0.5 . In this paper , we analyze boosting with respect to this basic condition on the base learner , to see if boosting ensures prediction of rarely occurring events with high recall and precision . First we show that a base learner can satisfy the required condition even for poor recall or precision levels , especially for very rare classes . Furthermore , we show that the intelligent weight updating mechanism in boosting , even in its strong cost-sensitive form , does not prevent cases where the base learner always achieves high precision but poor recall or high recall but poor precision , when mapped to the original distribution . In either of these cases , we show that the voting mechanism of boosting falls to achieve good overall recall and precision for the ensemble . In effect , our analysis indicates that one can not be blind to the base learner performance , and just rely on the boosting mechanism to take care of its weakness . We validate our arguments empirically on variety of real and synthetic rare class problems . In particular , using AdaCost as the boosting algorithm , and variations of PNrule and RIPPER as the base learners , we show that if algorithm A achieves better recall-precision balance than algorithm B , then using A as the base learner in AdaCost yields significantly better performance than using B as the base learner .", "4531703": "Local decomposition for rare class analysis . Given its importance , the problem of predicting rare classes in large-scale multi-labeled data sets has attracted great attentions in the literature . However , the rare-class problem remains a critical challenge , because there is no natural way developed for handling imbalanced class distributions . This paper thus fills this crucial void by developing a method for Classification using lOcal clusterinG ( COG ) . Specifically , for a data set with an imbalanced class distribution , we perform clustering within each large class and produce sub-classes with relatively balanced sizes . Then , we apply traditional supervised learning algorithms , such as Support Vector Machines ( SVMs ) , for classification . Indeed , our experimental results on various real-world data sets show that our method produces significantly higher prediction accuracies on rare classes than state-of-the-art methods . Furthermore , we show that COG can also improve the performance of traditional supervised learning algorithms on data sets with balanced class distributions .", "12116254": "Query chains : learning to rank from implicit feedback .

In this paper , we propose a unified algorithmic framework for solving many known variants of MDS .

In addition to the formal guarantees of convergence , our algorithms are accurate ; in most cases , they converge to better quality solutions than existing methods in comparable time . Moreover , they have a small memory footprint and scale effectively for large data sets . We expect that this framework will be useful for a number of MDS variants that have not yet been studied . Our framework extends to embedding high-dimensional points lying on a sphere to points on a lower dimensional sphere , preserving geodesic distances . As a complement to this result , we also extend the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma to this spherical setting , by showing that projecting to a random O ( ( 1 \\/ \u00b52 ) log n ) - dimensional sphere causes only an eps-distortion in the geodesic distances .", "4394712": "Making holistic schema matching robust : an ensemble approach . The Web has been rapidly `` deepened '' by myriad searchable databases online , where data are hidden behind query interfaces . As an essential task toward integrating these massive `` deep Web '' sources , large scale schema matching ( i.e. , discovering semantic correspondences of attributes across many query interfaces ) has been actively studied recently . In particular , many works have emerged to address this problem by `` holistically '' matching many schemas at the same time and thus pursuing `` mining '' approaches in nature . However , while holistic schema matching has built its promise upon the large quantity of input schemas , it also suffers the robustness problem caused by noisy data quality . Such noises often inevitably arise in the automatic extraction of schema data , which is mandatory in large scale integration . For holistic matching to be viable , it is thus essential to make it robust against noisy schemas . To tackle this challenge , we propose a data-ensemble framework with sampling and voting techniques , which is inspired by bagging predictors . Specifically , our approach creates an ensemble of matchers , by randomizing input schema data into many independently downsampled trials , executing the same matcher on each trial and then aggregating their ranked results by taking majority voting . As a principled basis , we provide analytic justification of the effectiveness of this data-ensemble framework . Further , empirically , our experiments on real Web data show that the `` ensemblization '' indeed significantly boosts the matching accuracy under noisy schema input , and thus maintains the desired robustness of a holistic matcher .", "13801985": "Compression of weighted graphs . We propose to compress weighted graphs ( networks ) , motivated by the observation that large networks of social , biological , or other relations can be complex to handle and visualize . In the process also known as graph simplification , nodes and ( unweighted ) edges are grouped to supernodes and superedges , respectively , to obtain a smaller graph . We propose models and algorithms for weighted graphs . The interpretation ( i.e. decompression ) of a compressed , weighted graph is that a pair of original nodes is connected by an edge if their supernodes are connected by one , and that the weight of an edge is approximated to be the weight of the superedge . The compression problem now consists of choosing supernodes , superedges , and superedge weights so that the approximation error is minimized while the amount of compression is maximized . In this paper , we formulate this task as the ` simple weighted graph compression problem ' . We then propose a much wider class of tasks under the name of ` generalized weighted graph compression problem ' . The generalized task extends the optimization to preserve longer-range connectivities between nodes , not just individual edge weights . We study the properties of these problems and propose a range of algorithms to solve them , with different balances between complexity and quality of the result . We evaluate the problems and algorithms experimentally on real networks . The results indicate that weighted graphs can be compressed efficiently with relatively little compression error .", "147623": "Style mining of electronic messages for multiple authorship discrimination : first results .

This paper is about a variant of k nearest neighbor classification on large many-class high dimensional datasets . K nearest neighbor remains a popular classification technique , especially in areas such as computer vision , drug activity prediction and astrophysics . Furthermore , many more modern classifiers , such as kernel-based Bayes classifiers or the prediction phase of SVMs , require computational regimes similar to k-NN . We believe that tractable k-NN algorithms therefore continue to be important . This paper relies on the insight that even with many classes , the task of finding the majority class among the k nearest neighbors of a query need not require us to explicitly find those k nearest neighbors . This insight was previously used in ( Liu et al. , 2003 ) in two algorithms called KNS2 and KNS3 which dealt with fast classification in the case of two classes . In this paper we show how a different approach , IOC ( standing for the International Olympic Committee ) can apply to the case of n classes where n ) 2 . IOC assumes a slightly different processing of the datapoints in the neighborhood of the query . This allows it to search a set of metric trees , one for each class .

We present a systematic approach for automating this task , because the number of images needing text descriptions is now rapidly increasing .

Traditionally , research in identifying structured entities in documents has proceeded independently of document categorization research .

This happens naturally in many enterprise domains such as CRM , Banking , etc. . Then , entity identification , which is typically vulnerable against noise and incompleteness in direct references to entities in documents , can benefit from document categorization with respect to such attributes . In return , entity identification enables documents to be categorized according to different label-sets arising from entity attributes without requiring any supervision . In this paper , we propose a probabilistic generative model for joint entity identification and document categorization . We show how the parameters of the model can be estimated using an EM algorithm in an unsupervised fashion .

Astronomy increasingly faces the issue of massive , unwieldly data sets . The Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) ( 11 ) has so far generated tens of millions of images of distant galaxies , of which only a tiny fraction have been morphologically classified . Morphological classification in this context is achieved by fitting a parametric model of galaxy shape to a galaxy image . This is a nonlinear regression problem , whose challenges are threefold , 1 ) blurring of the image caused by atmosphere and mirror imperfections , 2 ) large numbers of local minima , and 3 ) massive data sets . Our strategy is to use the eigenimages of the parametric model to form a new feature space , and then to map both target image and the model parameters into this feature space . In this low-dimensional space we search for the best image-to-parameter match . To search the space , we sample it by creating a database of many random parameter vectors ( prototypes ) and mapping them into the feature space . The search problem then becomes one of finding the best prototype match , so the fitting process a nearest-neighbor search . In addition to the savings realized by decomposing the original space into an eigenspace , we can use the fact that the model is a linear sum of functions to reduce the prototypes further : the only prototypes stored are the components of the model function . A modified form of nearest neighbor is used to search among them . Additional complications arise in the form of missing data and heteroscedasticity , both of which are addressed with weighted linear regression .

To cope with the curse of dimensionality , we employ sparse grids ( 49 ) . Thus , only O ( hn-1nd-1 ) instead of O ( hn-d ) grid points and unknowns are involved . Here d denotes the dimension of the feature space and hn = 2-n gives the mesh size .

Previous approaches either applies the constant step size which assumes that the Lipschitz gradient is known in advance , or requires a sequence of decreasing step size which leads to slow convergence in practice . In this paper , we propose an adaptive line search scheme which allows to tune the step size adaptively and meanwhile guarantees the optimal convergence rate . Empirical comparisons with several state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed Lassplore algorithm for large-scale problems .", "125023": "Explicitly representing expected cost : an alternative to ROC representation .", "6461568": "A general approach to incorporate data quality matrices into data mining algorithms . Data quality is a central issue for many information-oriented organizations . Recent advances in the data quality field reflect the view that a database is the product of a manufacturing process . While routine errors , such as non-existent zip codes , can be detected and corrected using traditional data cleansing tools , many errors systemic to the manufacturing process can not be addressed . Therefore , the product of the data manufacturing process is an imprecise recording of information about the entities of interest ( i.e. customers , transactions or assets ) . In this way , the database is only one ( flawed ) version of the entities it is supposed to represent . Quality assurance systems such as Motorola 's Six-Sigma and other continuous improvement methods document the data manufacturing process 's shortcomings . A widespread method of documentation is quality matrices . In this paper , we explore the use of the readily available data quality matrices for the data mining classification task . We first illustrate that if we do not factor in these quality matrices , then our results for prediction are sub-optimal . We then suggest a general-purpose ensemble approach that perturbs the data according to these quality matrices to improve the predictive accuracy and show the improvement is due to a reduction in variance .", "3852549": "Mining comparable bilingual text corpora for cross-language information integration . Integrating information in multiple natural languages is a challenging task that often requires manually created linguistic resources such as a bilingual dictionary or examples of direct translations of text . In this paper , we propose a general cross-lingual text mining method that does not rely on any of these resources , but can exploit comparable bilingual text corpora to discover mappings between words and documents in different languages . Comparable text corpora are collections of text documents in different languages that are about similar topics ; such text corpora are often naturally available ( e.g. , news articles in different languages published in the same time period ) . The main idea of our method is to exploit frequency correlations of words in different languages in the comparable corpora and discover mappings between words in different languages . Such mappings can then be used to further discover mappings between documents in different languages , achieving cross-lingual information integration . Evaluation of the proposed method on a 120MB Chinese-English comparable news collection shows that the proposed method is effective for mapping words and documents in English and Chinese . Since our method only relies on naturally available comparable corpora , it is generally applicable to any language pairs as long as we have comparable corpora .", "1217647": "Group formation in large social networks : membership , growth , and evolution . The processes by which communities come together , attract new members , and develop over time is a central research issue in the social sciences - political movements , professional organizations , and religious denominations all provide fundamental examples of such communities . In the digital domain , on-line groups are becoming increasingly prominent due to the growth of community and social networking sites such as MySpace and LiveJournal . However , the challenge of collecting and analyzing large-scale time-resolved data on social groups and communities has left most basic questions about the evolution of such groups largely unresolved : what are the structural features that influence whether individuals will join communities , which communities will grow rapidly , and how do the overlaps among pairs of communities change over time . Here we address these questions using two large sources of data : friendship links and community membership on LiveJournal , and co-authorship and conference publications in DBLP . Both of these datasets provide explicit user-defined communities , where conferences serve as proxies for communities in DBLP . We study how the evolution of these communities relates to properties such as the structure of the underlying social networks . We find that the propensity of individuals to join communities , and of communities to grow rapidly , depends in subtle ways on the underlying network structure . For example , the tendency of an individual to join a community is influenced not just by the number of friends he or she has within the community , but also crucially by how those friends are connected to one another . We use decision-tree techniques to identify the most significant structural determinants of these properties . We also develop a novel methodology for measuring movement of individuals between communities , and show how such movements are closely aligned with changes in the topics of interest within the communities .", "1450770": "Incremental context mining for adaptive document classification .

The issues call for adaptive document classification ( ADC ) that adapts a DC system to the evolving contextual requirement of each document category , so that input documents may be classified based on their contexts of discussion . We present an incremental context mining technique to tackle the challenges of ADC . Theoretical analyses and empirical results show that , given a text hierarchy , the mining technique is efficient in incrementally maintaining the evolving contextual requirement of each category .

Summarization is an important task in data mining . A major challenge over the past years has been the efficient construction of fixed-space synopses that provide a deterministic quality guarantee , often expressed in terms of a maximum-error metric . Histograms and several hierarchical techniques have been proposed for this problem . However , their time and\\/or space complexities remain impractically high and depend not only on the data set size n , but also on the space budget B. These handicaps stem from a requirement to tabulate all allocations of synopsis space to different regions of the data . In this paper we develop an alternative methodology that dispels these deficiencies , thanks to a fruitful application of the solution to the dual problem : given a maximum allowed error , determine the minimum-space synopsis that achieves it . Compared to the state-of-the-art , our histogram construction algorithm reduces time complexity by ( at least ) a Blog2n over log\u03b5 \\* factor and our hierarchical synopsis algorithm reduces the complexity by ( at least ) a factor of log2B over log\u03b5 \\* + logn in time and B ( 1-log B over log n ) in space , where \u03b5 \\* is the optimal error .

We are concerned with the issues of outlier detection and change point detection from a data stream . In the area of data mining , there have been increased interest in these issues since the former is related to fraud detection , rare event discovery , etc. , while the latter is related to event\\/trend by change detection , activity monitoring , etc. . Specifically , it is important to consider the situation where the data source is non-stationary , since the nature of data source may change over time in real applications . Although in most previous work outlier detection and change point detection have not been related explicitly , this paper presents a unifying framework for dealing with both of them on the basis of the theory of on-line learning of non-stationary time series . In this framework a probabilistic model of the data source is incrementally learned using an on-line discounting learning algorithm , which can track the changing data source adaptively by forgetting the effect of past data gradually . Then the score for any given data is calculated to measure its deviation from the learned model , with a higher score indicating a high possibility of being an outlier . Further change points in a data stream are detected by applying this scoring method into a time series of moving averaged losses for prediction using the learned model . Specifically we develop an efficient algorithms for on-line discounting learning of auto-regression models from time series data , and demonstrate the validity of our framework through simulation and experimental applications to stock market data analysis .", "331245": "A quickstart in frequent structure mining can make a difference .

In order to make graph mining more efficient , we investigate the use of the `` quickstart principle '' , which is based on the fact that these classes of structures are contained in each other , thus allowing for the development of structure mining algorithms that split the search into steps of increasing complexity .

Frequent patterns provide solutions to datasets that do not have well-structured feature vectors . However , frequent pattern mining is non-trivial since the number of unique patterns is exponential but many are non-discriminative and correlated . Currently , frequent pattern mining is performed in two sequential steps : enumerating a set of frequent patterns , followed by feature selection . Although many methods have been proposed in the past few years on how to perform each separate step efficiently , there is still limited success in eventually finding highly compact and discriminative patterns . The culprit is due to the inherent nature of this widely adopted two-step approach . This paper discusses these problems and proposes a new and different method . It builds a decision tree that partitions the data onto different nodes . Then at each node , it directly discovers a discriminative pattern to further divide its examples into purer subsets . Since the number of examples towards leaf level is relatively small , the new approach is able to examine patterns with extremely low global support that could not be enumerated on the whole dataset by the two-step method . The discovered feature vectors are more accurate on some of the most difficult graph as well as frequent itemset problems than most recently proposed algorithms but the total size is typically 50 % or more smaller . Importantly , the minimum support of some discriminative patterns can be extremely low ( e.g. 0.03 % ) . In order to enumerate these low support patterns , state-of-the-art frequent pattern algorithm either can not finish due to huge memory consumption or have to enumerate 101 to 103 times more patterns before they can even be found .

Personalization is ubiquitous in modern online applications as it provides significant improvements in user experience by adapting it to inferred user preferences . However , there are increasing concerns related to issues of privacy and control of the user data that is aggregated by online systems to power personalized experiences . These concerns are particularly significant for user profile aggregation in online advertising . This paper describes a practical , learning-driven client-side personalization approach for keyword advertising platforms , an emerging application previously not addressed in literature . Our approach relies on storing user-specific information entirely within the user 's control ( in a browser cookie or browser local storage ) , thus allowing the user to view , edit or purge it at any time ( e.g. , via a dedicated webpage ) . We develop a principled , utility-based formulation for the problem of iteratively updating user profiles stored client-side , which relies on calibrated prediction of future user activity . While optimal profile construction is NP-hard for pay-per-click advertising with bid increments , it can be efficiently solved via a greedy approximation algorithm guaranteed to provide a near-optimal solution due to the fact that keyword profile utility is submodular : it exhibits the property of diminishing returns with increasing profile size . We empirically evaluate client-side keyword profiles for keyword advertising on a large-scale dataset from a major search engine . Experiments demonstrate that predictive client-side personalization allows ad platforms to retain almost all of the revenue gains from personalization even if they give users the freedom to opt out of behavior tracking backed by server-side storage . Additionally , we show that advertisers can potentially increase their return on investment significantly by utilizing bid increments for keyword profiles in their ad campaigns .", "9647883": "Query result clustering for object-level search .

Contextual advertising on web pages has become very popular recently and it poses its own set of unique text mining challenges .

Learning for these targeting tasks is difficult since most training pages are multi-topic and need expensive human labeling at the sub-document level for accurate training . In this paper we investigate ways to learn for sub-document classification when only page level labels are available - these labels only indicate if the relevant content exists in the given page or not . We propose the application of multiple-instance learning to this task to improve the effectiveness of traditional methods . We apply sub-document classification to two different problems in contextual advertising . One is `` sensitive content detection '' where the advertiser wants to avoid content relating to war , violence , pornography , etc. even if they occur only in a small part of a page . The second problem involves opinion mining from review sites - the advertiser wants to detect and avoid negative opinion about their product when positive , negative and neutral sentiments co-exist on a page .

Support Vector Machines ( SVMs ) are among the most popular and successful classification algorithms . Kernel SVMs often reach state-of-the-art accuracies , but suffer from the curse of kernelization due to linear model growth with data size on noisy data . Linear SVMs have the ability to efficiently learn from truly large data , but they are applicable to a limited number of domains due to low representational power . To fill the representability and scalability gap between linear and nonlinear SVMs , we propose the Adaptive Multi-hyperplane Machine ( AMM ) algorithm that accomplishes fast training and prediction and has capability to solve nonlinear classification problems . AMM model consists of a set of hyperplanes ( weights ) , each assigned to one of the multiple classes , and predicts based on the associated class of the weight that provides the largest prediction . The number of weights is automatically determined through an iterative algorithm based on the stochastic gradient descent algorithm which is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum . Since the generalization bound decreases with the number of weights , a weight pruning mechanism is proposed and analyzed . The experiments on several large data sets show that AMM is nearly as fast during training and prediction as the state-of-the-art linear SVM solver and that it can be orders of magnitude faster than kernel SVM . In accuracy , AMM is somewhere between linear and kernel SVMs . For example , on an OCR task with 8 million highly dimensional training examples , AMM trained in 300 seconds on a single-core processor had 0.54 % error rate , which was significantly lower than 2.03 % error rate of a linear SVM trained in the same time and comparable to 0.43 % error rate of a kernel SVM trained in 2 days on 512 processors .

Although most time-series data mining research has concentrated on providing solutions for a single distance function , in this work we motivate the need for a single index structure that can support multiple distance measures . Our specific area of interest is the efficient retrieval and analysis of trajectory similarities . Trajectory datasets are very common in environmental applications , mobility experiments , video surveillance and are especially important for the discovery of certain biological patterns . Our primary similarity measure is based on the Longest Common Subsequence ( LCSS ) model , that offers enhanced robustness , particularly for noisy data , which are encountered very often in real world applications . However , our index is able to accommodate other distance measures as well , including the ubiquitous Euclidean distance , and the increasingly popular Dynamic Time Warping ( DTW ) . While other researchers have advocated one or other of these similarity measures , a major contribution of our work is the ability to support all these measures without the need to restructure the index . Our framework guarantees no false dismissals and can also be tailored to provide much faster response time at the expense of slightly reduced precision\\/recall . The experimental results demonstrate that our index can help speed-up the computation of expensive similarity measures such as the LCSS and the DTW .", "13997787": "Improving predictions using aggregate information . In domains such as consumer products or manufacturing amongst others , we have problems that warrant the prediction of a continuous target . Besides the usual set of explanatory attributes we may also have exact ( or approximate ) estimates of aggregated targets , which are the sums of disjoint sets of individual targets that we are trying to predict . Hence , the question now becomes can we use these aggregated targets , which are a coarser piece of information , to improve the quality of predictions of the individual targets ? In this paper , we provide a simple yet provable way of accomplishing this . In particular , given predictions from any regression model of the target on the test data , we elucidate a provable method for improving these predictions in terms of mean squared error , given exact ( or accurate enough ) information of the aggregated targets . These estimates of the aggregated targets may be readily available or obtained -- through multilevel regression -- at different levels of granularity . Based on the proof of our method we suggest a criterion for choosing the appropriate level . Moreover , in addition to estimates of the aggregated targets , if we have exact ( or approximate ) estimates of the mean and variance of the target distribution , then based on our general strategy we provide an optimal way of incorporating this information so as to further improve the quality of predictions of the individual targets .

Advanced analysis of data streams is quickly becoming a key area of data mining research as the number of applications demanding such processing increases .

When tackling non-stationary concepts , ensembles of classifiers have several advantages over single classifier methods : they are easy to scale and parallelize , they can adapt to change quickly by pruning under-performing parts of the ensemble , and they therefore usually also generate more accurate concept descriptions .

Graph clustering ( also called graph partitioning ) -- clustering the nodes of a graph -- is an important problem in diverse data mining applications . Traditional approaches involve optimization of graph clustering objectives such as normalized cut or ratio association ; spectral methods are widely used for these objectives , but they require eigenvector computation which can be slow . Recently , graph clustering with a general cut objective has been shown to be mathematically equivalent to an appropriate weighted kernel k-means objective function . In this paper , we exploit this equivalence to develop a very fast multilevel algorithm for graph clustering . Multilevel approaches involve coarsening , initial partitioning and refinement phases , all of which may be specialized to different graph clustering objectives . Unlike existing multilevel clustering approaches , such as METIS , our algorithm does not constrain the cluster sizes to be nearly equal . Our approach gives a theoretical guarantee that the refinement step decreases the graph cut objective under consideration . Experiments show that we achieve better final objective function values as compared to a state-of-the-art spectral clustering algorithm : on a series of benchmark test graphs with up to thirty thousand nodes and one million edges , our algorithm achieves lower normalized cut values in 67 % of our experiments and higher ratio association values in 100 % of our experiments . Furthermore , on large graphs , our algorithm is significantly faster than spectral methods .

Privacy preserving data processing has become an important topic recently because of advances in hardware technology which have lead to widespread proliferation of demographic and sensitive data . A rudimentary way to preserve privacy is to simply hide the information in some of the sensitive fields picked by a user . However , such a method is far from satisfactory in its ability to prevent adversarial data mining . Real data records are not randomly distributed . As a result , some fields in the records may be correlated with one another . If the correlation is sufficiently high , it may be possible for an adversary to predict some of the sensitive fields using other fields . In this paper , we study the problem of privacy preservation against adversarial data mining , which is to hide a minimal set of entries so that the privacy of the sensitive fields are satisfactorily preserved . In other words , even by data mining , an adversary still can not accurately recover the hidden data entries . We model the problem concisely and develop an efficient heuristic algorithm which can find good solutions in practice .

A spline based transformation method is proposed that is second order smooth , continuous , and minimizes the mean squared error between the response and each predictor .

Further , the number of sensors is increasing , so correlating data between sensors becomes ever more critical in order to distill knowlege from the data .

For any transaction data set with M transactions and N items , there is a unique lattice of at most M \\* N support envelopes that captures the structure of the association patterns in that data set .

Furthermore , the boundary of the support lattice -- the support boundary -- has at most min ( M , N ) envelopes and is especially interesting since it bounds the maximum sizes of potential association patterns -- not only for frequent , closed , and maximal itemsets , but also for patterns , such as error-tolerant itemsets , that are more general . The association structure can be represented graphically as a two-dimensional scatter plot of the ( m , n ) values associated with the support envelopes of the data set , a feature that is useful in the exploratory analysis of association patterns .

We present an algorithm that given examples of proximity comparisons among triples of objects ( object i is more like object j than object k ) , learns a distance function , in as few dimensions as possible , that preserves these distance relationships . The formulation is based on solving a linear programming optimization problem that finds an optimal mapping for the given dataset and distance relationships . Unlike other popular embedding algorithms , this method can easily generalize to new points , does not have local minima , and explicitly models computational efficiency by finding a mapping that is sparse , i.e. one that depends on a small subset of features or dimensions .

Diversified ranking on graphs is a fundamental mining task and has a variety of high-impact applications . There are two important open questions here . The first challenge is the measure - how to quantify the goodness of a given top-k ranking list that captures both the relevance and the diversity ? The second challenge lies in the algorithmic aspect - how to find an optimal , or near-optimal , top-k ranking list that maximizes the measure we defined in a scalable way ? In this paper , we address these challenges from an optimization point of view . Firstly , we propose a goodness measure for a given top-k ranking list . The proposed goodness measure intuitively captures both ( a ) the relevance between each individual node in the ranking list and the query ; and ( b ) the diversity among different nodes in the ranking list . Moreover , we propose a scalable algorithm ( linear wrt the size of the graph ) that generates a provably near-optimal solution .

A variety of mining and analysis problems -- ranging from association-rule discovery to contingency table analysis to materialization of certain approximate datacubes -- involve the extraction of knowledge from a set of categorical count data . Such data can be viewed as a collection of `` transactions , '' where a transaction is a fixed-length vector of counts . Classical algorithms for solving count-data problems require one or more computationally intensive passes over the entire database and can be prohibitively slow . One effective method for dealing with this ever-worsening scalability problem is to run the algorithms on a small sample of the data . We present a new data-reduction algorithm , called EASE , for producing such a sample . Like the FAST algorithm introduced by Chen et al. , EASE is especially designed for count data applications . Both EASE and FAST take a relatively large initial random sample and then deterministically produce a subsample whose `` distance '' -- appropriately defined -- from the complete database is minimal . Unlike FAST , which obtains the final subsample by quasi-greedy descent , EASE uses epsilon-approximation methods to obtain the final subsample by a process of repeated halving . Experiments both in the context of association rule mining and classical \u03c72 contingency-table analysis show that EASE outperforms both FAST and simple random sampling , sometimes dramatically .", "7101956": "Modeling relationships at multiple scales to improve accuracy of large recommender systems . The collaborative filtering approach to recommender systems predicts user preferences for products or services by learning past user-item relationships .

At a local scale , we use a neighborhood-based technique that infers ratings from observed ratings by similar users or of similar items . Unlike previous local approaches , our method is based on a formal model that accounts for interactions within the neighborhood , leading to improved estimation quality . At a higher , regional , scale , we use SVD-like matrix factorization for recovering the major structural patterns in the user-item rating matrix . Unlike previous approaches that require imputations in order to fill in the unknown matrix entries , our new iterative algorithm avoids imputation . Because the models involve estimation of millions , or even billions , of parameters , shrinkage of estimated values to account for sampling variability proves crucial to prevent overfitting .

The summarization proceeds in a level-wise iterative fashion . Occurrence statistics of itemsets at the lowest level are used to construct an initial MRF . Statistics of itemsets at the next level can then be inferred from the model . We use those patterns whose occurrence can not be accurately inferred from the model to augment the model in an iterative manner , repeating the procedure until all frequent itemsets can be modeled .

Link prediction , personalized graph search , fraud detection , and many such graph mining problems revolve around the computation of the most `` similar '' k nodes to a given query node . One widely used class of similarity measures is based on random walks on graphs , e.g. , personalized pagerank , hitting and commute times , and simrank . There are two fundamental problems associated with these measures . First , existing online algorithms typically examine the local neighborhood of the query node which can become significantly slower whenever high-degree nodes are encountered ( a common phenomenon in real-world graphs ) . We prove that turning high degree nodes into sinks results in only a small approximation error , while greatly improving running times . The second problem is that of computing similarities at query time when the graph is too large to be memory-resident . The obvious solution is to split the graph into clusters of nodes and store each cluster on a disk page ; ideally random walks will rarely cross cluster boundaries and cause page-faults . Our contributions here are twofold : ( a ) we present an efficient deterministic algorithm to find the k closest neighbors ( in terms of personalized pagerank ) of any query node in such a clustered graph , and ( b ) we develop a clustering algorithm ( RWDISK ) that uses only sequential sweeps over data files . Empirical results on several large publicly available graphs like DBLP , Citeseer and Live-Journal ( ~ 90 M edges ) demonstrate that turning high degree nodes into sinks not only improves running time of RWDISK by a factor of 3 but also boosts link prediction accuracy by a factor of 4 on average .

Normally , in these problems a partial order among frequent patterns can be defined in such a way as to preserve the downward closure property , with maximal frequent patterns being those without any successor with respect to this partial order . We investigate several variants of these mining problems in which the patterns of interest are subsequences , subtrees , or subgraphs , and show that the associated problems of counting the number of maximal frequent patterns are all either #P - complete or #P - hard .", "9050379": "Automatic identification of quasi-experimental designs for discovering causal knowledge . Researchers in the social and behavioral sciences routinely rely on quasi-experimental designs to discover knowledge from large data-bases . Quasi-experimental designs ( QEDs ) exploit fortuitous circumstances in non-experimental data to identify situations ( sometimes called `` natural experiments '' ) that provide the equivalent of experimental control and randomization . QEDs allow researchers in domains as diverse as sociology , medicine , and marketing to draw reliable inferences about causal dependencies from non-experimental data . Unfortunately , identifying and exploiting QEDs has remained a painstaking manual activity , requiring researchers to scour available databases and apply substantial knowledge of statistics . However , recent advances in the expressiveness of databases , and increases in their size and complexity , provide the necessary conditions to automatically identify QEDs . In this paper , we describe the first system to discover knowledge by applying quasi-experimental designs that were identified automatically . We demonstrate that QEDs can be identified in a traditional database schema and that such identification requires only a small number of extensions to that schema , knowledge about quasi-experimental design encoded in first-order logic , and a theorem-proving engine . We describe several key innovations necessary to enable this system , including methods for automatically constructing appropriate experimental units and for creating aggregate variables on those units . We show that applying the resulting designs can identify important causal dependencies in real domains , and we provide examples from academic publishing , movie making and marketing , and peer-production systems . Finally , we discuss the integration of QEDs with other approaches to causal discovery , including joint modeling and directed experimentation .", "7463889": "Customer targeting models using actively-selected web content .

Data Mining with Bayesian Network learning has two important characteristics : under conditions learned edges between variables correspond to casual influences , and second , for every variable T in the network a special subset ( Markov Blanket ) identifiable by the network is the minimal variable set required to predict T. However , all known algorithms learning a complete BN do not scale up beyond a few hundred variables . On the other hand , all known sound algorithms learning a local region of the network require an exponential number of training instances to the size of the learned region . The contribution of this paper is two-fold . We introduce a novel local algorithm that returns all variables with direct edges to and from a target variable T as well as a local algorithm that returns the Markov Blanket of T. Both algorithms ( i ) are sound , ( ii ) can be run efficiently in datasets with thousands of variables , and ( iii ) significantly outperform in terms of approximating the true neighborhood previous state-of-the-art algorithms using only a fraction of the training size required by the existing methods . A fundamental difference between our approach and existing ones is that the required sample depends on the generating graph connectivity and not the size of the local region ; this yields up to exponential savings in sample relative to previously known algorithms .

One important issue , not yet conveniently addressed , is the design of experimental work to evaluate and compare decision models that evolve over time . There are no golden standards for assessing performance in non-stationary environments . This paper proposes a general framework for assessing predictive stream learning algorithms . We defend the use of Predictive Sequential methods for error estimate - the prequential error . The prequential error allows us to monitor the evolution of the performance of models that evolve over time . Nevertheless , it is known to be a pessimistic estimator in comparison to holdout estimates . To obtain more reliable estimators we need some forgetting mechanism . Two viable alternatives are : sliding windows and fading factors . We observe that the prequential error converges to an holdout estimator when estimated over a sliding window or using fading factors . We present illustrative examples of the use of prequential error estimators , using fading factors , for the tasks of : i ) assessing performance of a learning algorithm ; ii ) comparing learning algorithms ; iii ) hypothesis testing using McNemar test ; and iv ) change detection using Page-Hinkley test .

The feature selection problem is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem which is computationally expensive . Traditional unsupervised feature selection methods address this issue by selecting the top ranked features based on certain scores computed independently for each feature .

When trained on this data , Hamlet -- our multi-strategy data mining algorithm -- generated a predictive model that saved 341 simulated passengers $ 198,074 by advising them when to buy and when to postpone ticket purchases . Remarkably , a clairvoyant algorithm with complete knowledge of future prices could save at most $ 320,572 in our simulation , thus HAMLET 's savings were 61.8 % of optimal . The algorithm 's savings of $ 198,074 represents an average savings of 23.8 % for the 341 passengers for whom savings are possible .

For many KDD operations , such as nearest neighbor search , distance-based clustering , and outlier detection , there is an underlying & kgr ;-D data space in which each tuple\\/object is represented as a point in the space .

The fundamental question that this paper addresses is : `` What then is an appropriate space ? '' We propose using a robust space transformation called the Donoho-Stahel estimator . In the first half of the paper , we show the key properties of the estimator . Of particular importance to KDD applications involving databases is the stability property , which says that in spite of frequent updates , the estimator does not : ( a ) change much , ( b ) lose its usefulness , or ( c ) require re-computation . In the second half , we focus on the computation of the estimator for high-dimensional databases . We develop randomized algorithms and evaluate how well they perform empirically .

This allows for a near-exhaustive evaluation of all possible splits in a node , based on the quality of fit of linear regression models in the resulting branches . We decompose the calculation of the Residual Sum of Squares in such a way that a large part of it is pre-computed . The resulting method is highly scalable .

Understanding the differences between contrasting groups is a fundamental task in data analysis .

To our surprise we observed that straightforward application of an existing commercial rule-discovery system , Magnum Opus , could successfully perform the contrast-set-mining task . This led to the realization that contrast-set mining is a special case of the more general rule-discovery task .

In data publishing , anonymization techniques such as generalization and bucketization have been designed to provide privacy protection . In the meanwhile , they reduce the utility of the data . It is important to consider the tradeoff between privacy and utility . In a paper that appeared in KDD 2008 , Brickell and Shmatikov proposed an evaluation methodology by comparing privacy gain with utility gain resulted from anonymizing the data , and concluded that `` even modest privacy gains require almost complete destruction of the data-mining utility '' . This conclusion seems to undermine existing work on data anonymization . In this paper , we analyze the fundamental characteristics of privacy and utility , and show that it is inappropriate to directly compare privacy with utility . We then observe that the privacy-utility tradeoff in data publishing is similar to the risk-return tradeoff in financial investment , and propose an integrated framework for considering privacy-utility tradeoff , borrowing concepts from the Modern Portfolio Theory for financial investment . Finally , we evaluate our methodology on the Adult dataset from the UCI machine learning repository . Our results clarify several common misconceptions about data utility and provide data publishers useful guidelines on choosing the right tradeoff between privacy and utility .", "7734521": "Combining proactive and reactive predictions for data streams . Mining data streams is important in both science and commerce . Two major challenges are ( 1 ) the data may grow without limit so that it is difficult to retain a long history ; and ( 2 ) the underlying concept of the data may change over time . Different from common practice that keeps recent raw data , this paper uses a measure of conceptual equivalence to organize the data history into a history of concepts . Along the journey of concept change , it identifies new concepts as well as re-appearing ones , and learns transition patterns among concepts to help prediction . Different from conventional methodology that passively waits until the concept changes , this paper incorporates proactive and reactive predictions . In a proactive mode , it anticipates what the new concept will be if a future concept change takes place , and prepares prediction strategies in advance . If the anticipation turns out to be correct , a proper prediction model can be launched instantly upon the concept change . If not , it promptly resorts to a reactive mode : adapting a prediction model to the new data . A system RePro is proposed to implement these new ideas . Experiments compare the system with representative existing prediction methods on various benchmark data sets that represent diversified scenarios of concept change . Empirical evidence demonstrates that the proposed methodology is an effective and efficient solution to prediction for data streams .", "8627363": "CVS : a Correlation-Verification based Smoothing technique on information retrieval and term clustering . As information volume in enterprise systems and in the Web grows rapidly , how to accurately retrieve information is an important research area . Several corpus based smoothing techniques have been proposed to address the data sparsity and synonym problems faced by information retrieval systems . Such smoothing techniques are often unable to discover and utilize the correlations among terms . We propose CVS , a Correlation-Verification based Smoothing method , that considers co-occurrence information in smoothing . Strongly correlated terms in a document are identified by their co-occurrence frequencies in the document . To avoid missing correlated terms with low co-occurrence frequencies but specific to the theme of the document , the joint distributions of terms in the document are compared with those in the corpus for statistical significance . A common approach to apply corpus based smoothing techniques to information retrieval is by refining the vector representations of documents . This paper investigates the effects of corpus based smoothing on information retrieval by query expansion using term clusters generated from a term clustering process . The results can also be viewed in light of the effects of smoothing on clustering . Empirical studies show that our approach outperforms previous corpus based smoothing techniques . It improves retrieval effectiveness by 14.6 % .

A fundamental open question in the analysis of social networks is to understand the interplay between similarity and social ties . People are similar to their neighbors in a social network for two distinct reasons : first , they grow to resemble their current friends due to social influence ; and second , they tend to form new links to others who are already like them , a process often termed selection by sociologists . While both factors are present in everyday social processes , they are in tension : social influence can push systems toward uniformity of behavior , while selection can lead to fragmentation . As such , it is important to understand the relative effects of these forces , and this has been a challenge due to the difficulty of isolating and quantifying them in real settings . We develop techniques for identifying and modeling the interactions between social influence and selection , using data from online communities where both social interaction and changes in behavior over time can be measured . We find clear feedback effects between the two factors , with rising similarity between two individuals serving , in aggregate , as an indicator of future interaction -- but with similarity then continuing to increase steadily , although at a slower rate , for long periods after initial interactions . We also consider the relative value of similarity and social influence in modeling future behavior . For instance , to predict the activities that an individual is likely to do next , is it more useful to know the current activities of their friends , or of the people most similar to them ?", "9418685": "Training structural svms with kernels using sampled cuts . Discriminative training for structured outputs has found increasing applications in areas such as natural language processing , bioinformatics , information retrieval , and computer vision .

While these algorithms are very efficient for linear models , their training complexity becomes quadratic in the number of examples when kernels are used . To overcome this bottleneck , we propose new training algorithms that use approximate cutting planes and random sampling to enable efficient training with kernels . We prove that these algorithms have improved time complexity while providing approximation guarantees . In empirical evaluations , our algorithms produced solutions with training and test error rates close to those of exact solvers .

The goal of a recommender system is to suggest items of interest to a user based on historical behavior of a community of users . Given detailed enough history , item-based collaborative filtering ( CF ) often performs as well or better than almost any other recommendation method . However , in cold-start situations - where a user , an item , or the entire system is new - simple non-personalized recommendations often fare better . We improve the scalability and performance of a previous approach to handling cold-start situations that uses filterbots , or surrogate users that rate items based only on user or item attributes . We show that introducing a very small number of simple filterbots helps make CF algorithms more robust . In particular , adding just seven global filterbots improves both user-based and item-based CF in cold-start user , cold-start item , and cold-start system settings . Performance is better when data is scarce , performance is no worse when data is plentiful , and algorithm efficiency is negligibly affected . We systematically compare a non-personalized baseline , user-based CF , item-based CF , and our bot-augmented user - and item-based CF algorithms using three data sets ( Yahoo !

Mining discrete patterns in binary data is important for subsampling , compression , and clustering . We consider rank-one binary matrix approximations that identify the dominant patterns of the data , while preserving its discrete property . A best approximation on such data has a minimum set of inconsistent entries , i.e. , mismatches between the given binary data and the approximate matrix . Due to the hardness of the problem , previous accounts of such problems employ heuristics and the resulting approximation may be far away from the optimal one . In this paper , we show that the rank-one binary matrix approximation can be reformulated as a 0-1 integer linear program ( ILP ) . However , the ILP formulation is computationally expensive even for small-size matrices . We propose a linear program ( LP ) relaxation , which is shown to achieve a guaranteed approximation error bound . We further extend the proposed formulations using the regularization technique , which is commonly employed to address overfitting . The LP formulation is restricted to medium-size matrices , due to the large number of variables involved for large matrices . Interestingly , we show that the proposed approximate formulation can be transformed into an instance of the minimum s-t cut problem , which can be solved efficiently by finding maximum flows . Our empirical study shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm based on the maximum flow .

Previous efforts on event detection from the web have focused primarily on web content and structure data ignoring the rich collection of web log data . In this paper , we propose the first approach to detect events from the click-through data , which is the log data of web search engines . The intuition behind event detection from click-through data is that such data is often event-driven and each event can be represented as a set ofquery-page pairs that are not only semantically similar but also have similar evolution pattern over time . Given the click-through data , in our proposed approach , we first segment it into a sequence of bipartite graphs based on theuser-defined time granularity . Next , the sequence of bipartite graphs is represented as a vector-based graph , which records the semantic and evolutionary relationships between queries and pages . After that , the vector-based graph is transformed into its dual graph , where each node is a query-page pair that will be used to represent real world events . Then , the problem of event detection is equivalent to the problem of clustering the dual graph of the vector-based graph . The clustering process is based on a two-phase graph cut algorithm . In the first phase , query-page pairs are clustered based on thesemantic-based similarity such that each cluster in the result corresponds to a specific topic . In the second phase , query-page pairs related to the same topic are further clustered based on the evolution pattern-based similarity such that each cluster is expected to represent a specific event under the specific topic .

Email is one of the most prevalent communication tools today , and solving the email overload problem is pressingly urgent . A good way to alleviate email overload is to automatically prioritize received messages according to the priorities of each user . However , research on statistical learning methods for fully personalized email prioritization ( PEP ) has been sparse due to privacy issues , since people are reluctant to share personal messages and importance judgments with the research community . It is therefore important to develop and evaluate PEP methods under the assumption that only limited training examples can be available , and that the system can only have the personal email data of each user during the training and testing of the model for that user . This paper presents the first study ( to the best of our knowledge ) under such an assumption . Specifically , we focus on analysis of personal social networks to capture user groups and to obtain rich features that represent the social roles from the viewpoint of a particular user . We also developed a novel semi-supervised ( transductive ) learning algorithm that propagates importance labels from training examples to test examples through message and user nodes in a personal email network . These methods together enable us to obtain an enriched vector representation of each new email message , which consists of both standard features of an email message ( such as words in the title or body , sender and receiver IDs , etc. ) and the induced social features from the sender and receivers of the message . Using the enriched vector representation as the input in SVM classifiers to predict the importance level for each test message , we obtained significant performance improvement over the baseline system ( without induced social features ) in our experiments on a multi-user data collection . We obtained significant performance improvement over the baseline system ( without induced social features ) in our experiments on a multi-user data collection : the relative error reduction in MAE was 31 % in micro-averaging , and 14 % in macro-averaging .", "1027147": "Towards NIC-based intrusion detection .

A standard approach to cross-language information retrieval ( CLIR ) uses Latent Semantic Analysis ( LSA ) in conjunction with a multilingual parallel aligned corpus . This approach has been shown to be successful in identifying similar documents across languages - or more precisely , retrieving the most similar document in one language to a query in another language . However , the approach has severe drawbacks when applied to a related task , that of clustering documents `` language-independently '' , so that documents about similar topics end up closest to one another in the semantic space regardless of their language . The problem is that documents are generally more similar to other documents in the same language than they are to documents in a different language , but on the same topic . As a result , when using multilingual LSA , documents will in practice cluster by language , not by topic . We propose a novel application of PARAFAC2 ( which is a variant of PARAFAC , a multi-way generalization of the singular value decomposition ( SVD ) ) to overcome this problem . Instead of forming a single multilingual term-by-document matrix which , under LSA , is subjected to SVD , we form an irregular three-way array , each slice of which is a separate term-by-document matrix for a single language in the parallel corpus . The goal is to compute an SVD for each language such that V ( the matrix of right singular vectors ) is the same across all languages . Effectively , PARAFAC2 imposes the constraint , not present in standard LSA , that the `` concepts '' in all documents in the parallel corpus are the same regardless of language . Intuitively , this constraint makes sense , since the whole purpose of using a parallel corpus is that exactly the same concepts are expressed in the translations . We tested this approach by comparing the performance of PARAFAC2 with standard LSA in solving a particular CLIR problem . From our results , we conclude that PARAFAC2 offers a very promising alternative to LSA not only for multilingual document clustering , but also for solving other problems in cross-language information retrieval .", "9927253": "Spatial-temporal causal modeling for climate change attribution .

The centroid of the members of a committee is used as the feature vector of the cluster . We proceed by assigning words to their most similar clusters . After assigning an element to a cluster , we remove their overlapping features from the element . This allows CBC to discover the less frequent senses of a word and to avoid discovering duplicate senses . Each cluster that a word belongs to represents one of its senses . We also present an evaluation methodology for automatically measuring the precision and recall of discovered senses .", "9317346": "Hypergraph spectral learning for multi-label classification . A hypergraph is a generalization of the traditional graph in which the edges are arbitrary non-empty subsets of the vertex set . It has been applied successfully to capture high-order relations in various domains . In this paper , we propose a hypergraph spectral learning formulation for multi-label classification , where a hypergraph is constructed to exploit the correlation information among different labels . We show that the proposed formulation leads to an eigenvalue problem , which may be computationally expensive especially for large-scale problems . To reduce the computational cost , we propose an approximate formulation , which is shown to be equivalent to a least squares problem under a mild condition . Based on the approximate formulation , efficient algorithms for solving least squares problems can be applied to scale the formulation to very large data sets . In addition , existing regularization techniques for least squares can be incorporated into the model for improved generalization performance . We have conducted experiments using large-scale benchmark data sets , and experimental results show that the proposed hypergraph spectral learning formulation is effective in capturing the high-order relations in multi-label problems . Results also indicate that the approximate formulation is much more efficient than the original one , while keeping competitive classification performance .", "3859887": "Generating semantic annotations for frequent patterns with context analysis . As a fundamental data mining task , frequent pattern mining has widespread applications in many different domains . Research in frequent pattern mining has so far mostly focused on developing efficient algorithms to discover various kinds of frequent patterns , but little attention has been paid to the important nextstep - interpreting the discovered frequent patterns . Although some recent work has studied the compression and summarization of frequent patterns , the proposed techniques can only annotate a frequent pattern with non-semantical information ( e.g. support ) , which provides only limited help for a user to understand the patterns . In this paper , we propose the novel problem of generating semantic annotations for frequent patterns . The goal is to annotate a frequent pattern with in-depth , concise , and structured information that can better indicate the hidden meanings of the pattern . We propose a general approach to generate such anannotation for a frequent pattern by constructing its context model , selecting informative context indicators , and extracting representative transactions and semantically similar patterns . This general approach has potentially many applications such as generating a dictionary-like description for a pattern , finding synonym patterns , discovering semantic relations , and summarizing semantic classes of a set of frequent patterns .

Social tagging systems have become increasingly popular for sharing and organizing web resources . Tag prediction is a common feature of social tagging systems . Social tagging by nature is an incremental process , meaning that once a user has saved a web page with tags , the tagging system can provide more accurate predictions for the user , based on user 's incremental behaviors . However , existing tag prediction methods do not consider this important factor , in which their training and test datasets are either split by a fixed time stamp or randomly sampled from a larger corpus . In our temporal experiments , we perform a time-sensitive sampling on an existing public dataset , resulting in a new scenario which is much closer to `` real-world '' . In this paper , we address the problem of tag prediction by proposing a probabilistic model for personalized tag prediction . The model is a Bayesian approach , and integrates three factors - ego-centric effect , environmental effects and web page content . Two methods - both intuitive calculation and learning optimization - are provided for parameter estimation . Pure graphbased methods which may have significant constraints ( such as every user , every item and every tag has to occur in at least p posts ) , can not make a prediction in most of `` real world '' cases while our model improves the F-measure by over 30 % compared to a leading algorithm , in our `` real-world '' use case .", "989744": "On the potential of domain literature for clustering and Bayesian network learning . Thanks to its increasing availability , electronic literature can now be a major source of information when developing complex statistical models where data is scarce or contains much noise .

Because quantifying similarities or dependencies between variables is a basic building block in knowledge discovery , we consider here the following question . Which vector representations of text and which statistical scores of similarity or dependency support best the use of literature in statistical models ? For the text source , we assume to have annotations for the domain variables as short free-text descriptions and optionally to have a large literature repository from which we can further expand the annotations . For evaluation , we contrast the variables similarities or dependencies obtained from text using different annotation sources and vector representations with those obtained from measurement data or expert assessments . Specifically , we consider two learning problems : clustering and Bayesian network learning .

We introduce a general method that can extract quantitative information on the linear dependencies within a correlation clustering . Our concepts are independent of the clustering model and can thus be applied as a post-processing step to any correlation clustering algorithm .

The difficulty is that the profit of one item not only comes from its own sales , but also from its influence on the sales of other items , i.e. , the `` cross-selling effect '' . In this paper , we draw an analogy between this influence and the mutual reinforcement of hub\\/authority web pages . Based on this analogy , we present a novel approach to the item ranking problem . We apply this ranking approach to solve two selection problems . In size-constrained selection , the maximum number of items that can be selected is fixed . In cost-constrained selection , there is no maximum number of items to be selected , but there is some cost associated with the selection of each item . In both cases , the question is what items should be selected to maximize the profit . Empirically , we show that this method finds profitable items in the presence of cross-selling effect .", "10008070": "Consensus group stable feature selection .

We test our algorithm on real high-dimensional data sets with millions of examples and show that the near linear scaling holds over several orders of magnitude .

To construct a time series of ratings for an item , we use a window size of k to group consecutive ratings for the item into disjoint windows and compute the sample average and sample entropy in each window . We derive a theoretically optimal window size to best detect an attack event if the number of attack profiles is known . For practical applications where this number is unknown , we propose a heuristic algorithm that adaptively changes the window size . Our experimental results demonstrate that monitoring rating distributions in time series is an effective approach for detecting shilling attacks .", "736839": "Mining coherent gene clusters from gene-sample-time microarray data .

Classification has been commonly used in many data mining projects in the financial service industry . For instance , to predict collectability of accounts receivable , a binary class label is created based on whether a payment is received within a certain period . However , optimization of the classifier does not necessarily lead to maximization of return on investment ( ROI ) , since maximization of the true positive rate is often different from maximization of the collectable amount which determines the ROI under a fixed budget constraint . The typical cost sensitive learning does not solve this problem either since it involves an unknown opportunity cost due to the budget constraint . Learning the ranks of collectable amount would ultimately solve the problem , but it tries to tackle an unnecessarily difficult problem and often results in poorer results for our specific target . We propose a new algorithm that uses gradient descent to directly optimize the related monetary measure under the budget constraint and thus maximizes the ROI .

We show that generalizing the concept of frequency while preserving the performance of mining algorithms is nontrivial , and introduce a generalization of frequent itemsets , dense itemsets . Dense itemsets do not require all attributes to be present at the same time ; instead , the itemset needs to define a sufficiently large submatrix that exceeds a given density threshold of attributes present . We consider the problem of computing all dense itemsets in a database . We give a levelwise algorithm for this problem , and also study the top - $ k $ variations , i.e. , finding the k densest sets with a given support , or the k best-supported sets with a given density . These algorithms select the other parameter automatically , which simplifies mining dense itemsets in an explorative way . We show that the concept captures natural facets of data sets , and give extensive empirical results on the performance of the algorithms .

In recent years , the technological advances in mapping genes have made it increasingly easy to store and use a wide variety of biological data . Such data are usually in the form of very long strings for which it is difficult to determine the most relevant features for a classification task . For example , a typical DNA string may be millions of characters long , and there may be thousands of such strings in a database . In many cases , the classification behavior of the data may be hidden in the compositional behavior of certain segments of the string which can not be easily determined apriori . Another problem which complicates the classification task is that in some cases the classification behavior is reflected in global behavior of the string , whereas in others it is reflected in local patterns . Given the enormous variation in the behavior of the strings over different data sets , it is useful to develop an approach which is sensitive to both the global and local behavior of the strings for the purpose of classification . For this purpose , we will exploit the multi-resolution property of wavelet decomposition in order to create a scheme which can mine classification characteristics at different levels of granularity . The resulting scheme turns out to be very effective in practice on a wide range of problems .", "10837037": "Learning patterns in the dynamics of biological networks .

Most current graph-based data mining approaches overlook dynamic features of biological networks , because they are focused on only static graphs .

Social media such as blogs , Facebook , Flickr , etc. , presents data in a network format rather than classical IID distribution . To address the interdependency among data instances , relational learning has been proposed , and collective inference based on network connectivity is adopted for prediction . However , connections in social media are often multi-dimensional . An actor can connect to another actor for different reasons , e.g. , alumni , colleagues , living in the same city , sharing similar interests , etc. . Collective inference normally does not differentiate these connections . In this work , we propose to extract latent social dimensions based on network information , and then utilize them as features for discriminative learning . These social dimensions describe diverse affiliations of actors hidden in the network , and the discriminative learning can automatically determine which affiliations are better aligned with the class labels . Such a scheme is preferred when multiple diverse relations are associated with the same network . We conduct extensive experiments on social media data ( one from a real-world blog site and the other from a popular content sharing site ) . Our model outperforms representative relational learning methods based on collective inference , especially when few labeled data are available . The sensitivity of this model and its connection to existing methods are also examined .", "4413738": "Using structure indices for efficient approximation of network properties . Statistics on networks have become vital to the study of relational data drawn from areas such as bibliometrics , fraud detection , bioinformatics , and the Internet . Calculating many of the most important measures - such as betweenness centrality , closeness centrality , and graph diameter-requires identifying short paths in these networks . However , finding these short paths can be intractable for even moderate-size networks . We introduce the concept of a network structure index ( NSI ) , a composition of ( 1 ) a set of annotations on every node in the network and ( 2 ) a function that uses the annotations to estimate graph distance between pairs of nodes . We present several varieties of NSIs , examine their time and space complexity , and analyze their performance on synthetic and real data sets . We show that creating an NSI for a given network enables extremely efficient and accurate estimation of a wide variety of network statistics on that network .", "2316298": "Application of neural networks to biological data mining : a case study in protein sequence classification .", "580786": "SVM selective sampling for ranking with application to data retrieval . Learning ranking ( or preference ) functions has been a major issue in the machine learning community and has produced many applications in information retrieval . SVMs ( Support Vector Machines ) - a classification and regression methodology - have also shown excellent performance in learning ranking functions . They effectively learn ranking functions of high generalization based on the `` large-margin '' principle and also systematically support nonlinear ranking by the `` kernel trick '' . In this paper , we propose an SVM selective sampling technique for learning ranking functions . SVM selective sampling ( or active learning with SVM ) has been studied in the context of classification . Such techniques reduce the labeling effort in learning classification functions by selecting only the most informative samples to be labeled . However , they are not extendable to learning ranking functions , as the labeled data in ranking is relative ordering , or partial orders of data . Our proposed sampling technique effectively learns an accurate SVM ranking function with fewer partial orders . We apply our sampling technique to the data retrieval application , which enables fuzzy search on relational databases by interacting with users for learning their preferences . Experimental results show a significant reduction of the labeling effort in inducing accurate ranking functions .", "4713024": "Detecting outliers using transduction and statistical testing . Outlier detection can uncover malicious behavior in fields like intrusion detection and fraud analysis . Although there has been a significant amount of work in outlier detection , most of the algorithms proposed in the literature are based on a particular definition of outliers ( e.g. , density-based ) , and use ad-hoc thresholds to detect them . In this paper we present a novel technique to detect outliers with respect to an existing clustering model . However , the test can also be successfully utilized to recognize outliers when the clustering information is not available . Our method is based on Transductive Confidence Machines , which have been previously proposed as a mechanism to provide individual confidence measures on classification decisions . The test uses hypothesis testing to prove or disprove whether a point is fit to be in each of the clusters of the model . We experimentally demonstrate that the test is highly robust , and produces very few misdiagnosed points , even when no clustering information is available . Furthermore , our experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method under the circumstances of data contaminated by outliers . We finally show that our technique can be successfully applied to identify outliers in a noisy data set for which no information is available ( e.g. , ground truth , clustering structure , etc. ) . As such our proposed methodology is capable of bootstrapping from a noisy data set a clean one that can be used to identify future outliers .", "13840249": "Mining top-k frequent items in a data stream with flexible sliding windows . We study the problem of finding the k most frequent items in a stream of items for the recently proposed max-frequency measure . Based on the properties of an item , the max-frequency of an item is counted over a sliding window of which the length changes dynamically . Besides being parameterless , this way of measuring the support of items was shown to have the advantage of a faster detection of bursts in a stream , especially if the set of items is heterogeneous . The algorithm that was proposed for maintaining all frequent items , however , scales poorly when the number of items becomes large . Therefore , in this paper we propose , instead of reporting all frequent items , to only mine the top-k most frequent ones . First we prove that in order to solve this problem exactly , we still need a prohibitive amount of memory ( at least linear in the number of items ) . Yet , under some reasonable conditions , we show both theoretically and empirically that a memory-efficient algorithm exists .

To address these issues , this paper proposes D-Stream , a framework for clustering stream data using adensity-based approach . The algorithm uses an online component which maps each input data record into a grid and an offline component which computes the grid density and clusters the grids based on the density . The algorithm adopts a density decaying technique to capture the dynamic changes of a data stream . Exploiting the intricate relationships between the decay factor , data density and cluster structure , our algorithm can efficiently and effectively generate and adjust the clusters in real time . Further , a theoretically sound technique is developed to detect and remove sporadic grids mapped to by outliers in order to dramatically improve the space and time efficiency of the system .

We propose a general framework for stable feature selection which emphasizes both good generalization and stability of feature selection results . The framework identifies dense feature groups based on kernel density estimation and treats features in each dense group as a coherent entity for feature selection . An efficient algorithm DRAGS ( Dense Relevant Attribute Group Selector ) is developed under this framework .

This work introduces a new family of link-based dissimilarity measures between nodes of a weighted directed graph . This measure , called the randomized shortest-path ( RSP ) dissimilarity , depends on a parameter \u03b8 and has the interesting property of reducing , on one end , to the standard shortest-path distance when \u03b8 is large and , on the other end , to the commute-time ( or resistance ) distance when \u03b8 is small ( near zero ) . Intuitively , it corresponds to the expected cost incurred by a random walker in order to reach a destination node from a starting node while maintaining a constant entropy ( related to \u03b8 ) spread in the graph . The parameter \u03b8 is therefore biasing gradually the simple random walk on the graph towards the shortest-path policy . By adopting a statistical physics approach and computing a sum over all the possible paths ( discrete path integral ) , it is shown that the RSP dissimilarity from every node to a particular node of interest can be computed efficiently by solving two linear systems of n equations , where n is the number of nodes . On the other hand , the dissimilarity between every couple of nodes is obtained by inverting an n x n matrix .

Privacy-preserving data mining ( PPDM ) is an emergent research area that addresses the incorporation of privacy preserving concerns to data mining techniques . In this paper we propose a privacy-preserving ( PP ) Cox model for survival analysis , and consider a real clinical setting where the data is horizontally distributed among different institutions . The proposed model is based on linearly projecting the data to a lower dimensional space through an optimal mapping obtained by solving a linear programming problem . Our approach differs from the commonly used random projection approach since it instead finds a projection that is optimal at preserving the properties of the data that are important for the specific problem at hand . Since our proposed approach produces an sparse mapping , it also generates a PP mapping that not only projects the data to a lower dimensional space but it also depends on a smaller subset of the original features ( it provides explicit feature selection ) . Real data from several European healthcare institutions are used to test our model for survival prediction of non-small-cell lung cancer patients .

The problem of interestingness of discovered rules has been investigated by many researchers . The issue is that data mining algorithms often generate too many rules , which make it very hard for the user to find the interesting ones . Over the years many techniques have been proposed . However , few have made it to real-life applications . Since August 2004 , we have been working on a major application for Motorola . The objective is to find causes of cellular phone call failures from a large amount of usage log data . Class association rules have been shown to be suitable for this type of diagnostic data mining application . We were also able to put several existing interestingness methods to the test , which revealed some major shortcomings . One of the main problems is that most existing methods treat rules individually . However , we discovered that users seldom regard a single rule to be interesting by itself . A rule is only interesting in the context of some other rules . Furthermore , in many cases , each individual rule may not be interesting , but a group of them together can represent an important piece of knowledge . This led us to discover a deficiency of the current rule mining paradigm . Using non-zero minimum support and non-zero minimum confidence eliminates a large amount of context information , which makes rule analysis difficult . This paper proposes a novel approach to deal with all of these issues , which casts rule analysis as OLAP operations and general impression mining . This approach enables the user to explore the knowledge space to find useful knowledge easily and systematically . It also provides a natural framework for visualization .

Data clustering has attracted a lot of research attention in the field of computational statistics and data mining . In most related studies , the dissimilarity between two clusters is defined as the distance between their centroids , or the distance between two closest ( or farthest ) data points . However , all of these measurements are vulnerable to outliers , and removing the outliers precisely is yet another difficult task . In view of this , we propose a new similarity measurement referred to as cohesion , to measure the inter-cluster distances . By using this new measurement of cohesion , we design a two-phase clustering algorithm , called cohesion-based self-merging ( abbreviated as CSM ) , which runs in linear time to the size of input data set . Combining the features of partitional and hierarchical clustering methods , algorithm CSM partitions the input data set into several small subclusters in the first phase , and then continuously merges the subclusters based on cohesion in a hierarchical manner in the second phase . As shown by our performance studies , the cohesion-based clustering is very robust and possesses the excellent tolerance to outliers in various workloads . More importantly , algorithm CSM is shown to be able to cluster the data sets of arbitrary shapes very efficiently , and provide better clustering results than those by prior methods .

Traditional gene selection methods often select the top-ranked genes according to their individual discriminative power without handling the high degree of redundancy among the genes . Latest research shows that removing redundant genes among selected ones can achieve a better representation of the characteristics of the targeted phenotypes and lead to improved classification accuracy . Hence , we study in this paper the relationship between feature relevance and redundancy and propose an efficient method that can effectively remove redundant genes .

Dimensionality reduction plays an important role in many data mining applications involving high-dimensional data .

Another method is random sampling . We propose an approach for distributed multivariate regression based on sampling and discuss its relationship with the compression method . The central idea is motivated by the observation that , although communication is limited , each individual site can still scan and process all the data it holds . Thus it is possible for the site to communicate only influential samples without seeing data in other sites .

To enable information integration , schema matching is a critical step for discovering semantic correspondences of attributes across heterogeneous sources . While complex matchings are common , because of their far more complex search space , most existing techniques focus on simple 1:1 matchings . To tackle this challenge , this paper takes a conceptually novel approach by viewing schema matching as correlation mining , for our task of matching Web query interfaces to integrate the myriad databases on the Internet . On this `` deep Web , '' query interfaces generally form complex matchings between attribute groups ( e.g. , ( author ) corresponds to ( first name , last name ) in the Books domain ) . We observe that the co-occurrences patterns across query interfaces often reveal such complex semantic relationships : grouping attributes ( e.g. , ( first name , last name ) ) tend to be co-present in query interfaces and thus positively correlated . In contrast , synonym attributes are negatively correlated because they rarely co-occur . This insight enables us to discover complex matchings by a correlation mining approach . In particular , we develop the DCM framework , which consists of data preparation , dual mining of positive and negative correlations , and finally matching selection . Unlike previous correlation mining algorithms , which mainly focus on finding strong positive correlations , our algorithm cares both positive and negative correlations , especially the subtlety of negative correlations , due to its special importance in schema matching . This leads to the introduction of a new correlation measure , $ H$ - measure , distinct from those proposed in previous work .

In traditional text clustering methods , documents are represented as `` bags of words '' without considering the semantic information of each document .

The published literature in a particular research field can be seen to exhibit similar phenomena over a much longer time scale .

The goal of the present work is to develop a formal approach for modeling such `` bursts , '' in such a way that they can be robustly and efficiently identified , and can provide an organizational framework for analyzing the underlying content . The approach is based on modeling the stream using an infinite-state automaton , in which bursts appear naturally as state transitions ; in some ways , it can be viewed as drawing an analogy with models from queueing theory for bursty network traffic .

Most data mining algorithms require the setting of many input parameters . Two main dangers of working with parameter-laden algorithms are the following . First , incorrect settings may cause an algorithm to fail in finding the true patterns . Second , a perhaps more insidious problem is that the algorithm may report spurious patterns that do not really exist , or greatly overestimate the significance of the reported patterns . This is especially likely when the user fails to understand the role of parameters in the data mining process . Data mining algorithms should have as few parameters as possible , ideally none . A parameter-free algorithm would limit our ability to impose our prejudices , expectations , and presumptions on the problem at hand , and would let the data itself speak to us . In this work , we show that recent results in bioinformatics and computational theory hold great promise for a parameter-free data-mining paradigm . The results are motivated by observations in Kolmogorov complexity theory . However , as a practical matter , they can be implemented using any off-the-shelf compression algorithm with the addition of just a dozen or so lines of code .

Based on the occurrence of the features ( terms ) in the set of pages , it calculates entropy value of each feature . According to the entropy value of each feature in a content block , the entropy value of the block is defined . By analyzing the information measure , we propose a method to dynamically select the entropy-threshold that partitions blocks into either informative or redundant . Informative content blocks are distinguished parts of the page , whereas redundant content blocks are common parts .

That is , using the approach , informative blocks ( news articles ) of these sites can be automatically separated from semantically redundant contents such as advertisements , banners , navigation panels , news categories , etc. .

Memory leaks are caused by software programs that prevent the reclamation of memory that is no longer in use . They can cause significant slowdowns , exhaustion of available storage space and , eventually , application crashes . Detecting memory leaks is challenging because real-world applications are built on multiple layers of software frameworks , making it difficult for a developer to know whether observed references to objects are legitimate or the cause of a leak . We present a graph mining solution to this problem wherein we analyze heap dumps to automatically identify subgraphs which could represent potential memory leak sources . Although heap dumps are commonly analyzed in existing heap profiling tools , our work is the first to apply a graph grammar mining solution to this problem . Unlike classical graph mining work , we show that it suffices to mine the dominator tree of the heap dump , which is significantly smaller than the underlying graph . Our approach identifies not just leaking candidates and their structure , but also provides aggregate information about the access path to the leaks .

We introduce the concept of one rule set being more robust than another , that is , able to make more accurate predictions on test data with missing attribute values . We show that the optimal class association rule set is as robust as the complete class association rule set . We then introduce the k-optimal rule set , which provides predictions exactly the same as the optimal class association rule set on test data with up to k missing attribute values . This leads to a hierarchy of k-optimal rule sets in which decreasing size corresponds to decreasing robustness , and they all more robust than a traditional classification rule set . We introduce two methods to find k-optimal rule sets , i.e. an optimal association rule mining approach and a heuristic approximate approach .

The community is represented by its structure and temporal dynamics : a community graph indicates how often one blog communicates with another , and a community intensity indicates the activity level of the community that varies over time . Our method , community factorization , extracts such communities from the blogosphere , where the communication among blogs is observed as a set of subgraphs ( i.e. , threads of discussion ) . This community extraction is formulated as a factorization problem in the framework of constrained optimization , in which the objective is to best explain the observed interactions in the blogosphere over time .

We tackle these challenges by developing a method for tracing paths of diffusion and influence through networks and inferring the networks over which contagions propagate . Given the times when nodes adopt pieces of information or become infected , we identify the optimal network that best explains the observed infection times . Since the optimization problem is NP-hard to solve exactly , we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that scales to large datasets and in practice gives provably near-optimal performance . We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by tracing information cascades in a set of 170 million blogs and news articles over a one year period to infer how information flows through the online media space .

Unfortunately , traditional data mining algorithms usually only explore one relation , the so-called target relation , thus excluding crucial knowledge embedded in the related so-called background relations .

Airlines routinely overbook flights based on the expectation that some fraction of booked passengers will not show for each flight . Accurate forecasts of the expected number of no-shows for each flight can increase airline revenue by reducing the number of spoiled seats ( empty seats that might otherwise have been sold ) and the number of involuntary denied boardings at the departure gate . Conventional no-show forecasting methods typically average the no-show rates of historically similar flights , without the use of passenger-specific information . We develop two classes of models to predict cabin-level no-show rates using specific information on the individual passengers booked on each flight . The first of these models computes the no-show probability for each passenger , using both the cabin-level historical forecast and the extracted passenger features as explanatory variables . This passenger-level model is implemented using three different predictive methods : a C4 .5 decision-tree , a segmented Naive Bayes algorithm , and a new aggregation method for an ensemble of probabilistic models . The second cabin-level model is formulated using the desired cabin-level no-show rate as the response variable . Inputs to this model include the predicted cabin-level no-show rates derived from the various passenger-level models , as well as simple statistics of the features of the cabin passenger population . The cabin-level model is implemented using either linear regression , or as a direct probability model with explicit incorporation of the cabin-level no-show rates derived from the passenger-level model outputs . The new passenger-based models are compared to a conventional historical model , using train and evaluation data sets taken from over 1 million passenger name records . Standard metrics such as lift curves and mean-square cabin-level errors establish the improved accuracy of the passenger-based models over the historical model .

Unfortunately , it is often difficult to ascertain that sophisticated statistical techniques , potentially employing additional external data sources , are unable to break anonymity . In this paper , we consider an instance of this problem , where the object of interest is the structure of a social network , i.e. , a graph describing users and their links .

We attempt to shed light on the following question : can we assume that a sufficiently sparse network is inherently anonymous , in the sense that even with unlimited computational power , de-anonymization is impossible ? Our approach is to introduce a random graph model for a version of the de-anonymization problem , which is parameterized by the expected node degree and a similarity parameter that controls the correlation between two graphs over the same vertex set .

One of the main problems related to the discovery of these associations is the scalability issue . Microarrays usually contain very large numbers of genes that are sometimes measured in 10,000 s. Therefore , analysis of such data can generate a very large number of associations that can often be measured in millions . The paper addresses this problem by presenting a method that enables biologists to evaluate these very large numbers of discovered association rules during the post-analysis stage of the data mining process . This is achieved by providing several rule evaluation operators , including rule grouping , filtering , browsing , and data inspection operators , that allow biologists to validate multiple individual gane regulation patterns at a time . By iteratively applying these operators , biologists can explore a significant part of all the initially generated rules in an acceptable period of time and thus answer biological questions that are of a particular interest to him or her .

We focus on large graphs where nodes have attributes , such as a social network where the nodes are labeled with each person 's job title . In such a setting , we want to find subgraphs that match a user query pattern . For example , a `` star '' query would be , `` find a CEO who has strong interactions with a Manager , a Lawyer , and an Accountant , or another structure as close to that as possible '' . Similarly , a `` loop '' query could help spot a money laundering ring . Traditional SQL-based methods , as well as more recent graph indexing methods , will return no answer when an exact match does not exist . This is the first main feature of our method . It can find exact - , as well as near-matches , and it will present them to the user in our proposed `` goodness '' order . For example , our method tolerates indirect paths between , say , the `` CEO '' and the `` Accountant '' of the above sample query , when direct paths do n't exist . Its second feature is scalability . In general , if the query has nq nodes and the data graph has n nodes , the problem needs polynomial time complexity O ( n n q ) , which is prohibitive . Our G-Ray ( `` Graph X-Ray '' ) method finds high-quality subgraphs in time linear on the size of the data graph . Experimental results on the DLBP author-publication graph ( with 356K nodes and 1.9 M edges ) illustrate both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach . The results agree with our intuition , and the speed is excellent . It takes 4 seconds on average fora 4-node query on the DBLP graph .", "10061437": "Bypass rates : reducing query abandonment using negative inferences . We introduce a new approach to analyzing click logs by examining both the documents that are clicked and those that are bypassed-documents returned higher in the ordering of the search results but skipped by the user . This approach complements the popular click-through rate analysis , and helps to draw negative inferences in the click logs . We formulate a natural objective that finds sets of results that are unlikely to be collectively bypassed by a typical user . This is closely related to the problem of reducing query abandonment . We analyze a greedy approach to optimizing this objective , and establish theoretical guarantees of its performance . We evaluate our approach on a large set of queries , and demonstrate that it compares favorably to the maximal marginal relevance approach on a number of metrics including mean average precision and mean reciprocal rank .", "5228328": "Extracting relevant named entities for automated expense reimbursement . Expense reimbursement is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process across organizations . In this paper , we present a prototype expense reimbursement system that dramatically reduces the elapsed time and costs involved , by eliminating paper from the process life cycle . Our complete solution involves ( 1 ) an electronic submission infrastructure that provides multi - channel image capture , secure transport and centralized storage of paper documents ; ( 2 ) an unconstrained data mining approach to extracting relevant named entities from un-structured document images ; ( 3 ) automation of auditing procedures that enables automatic expense validation with minimum human interaction . Extracting relevant named entities robustly from document images with unconstrained layouts and diverse formatting is a fundamental technical challenge to image-based data mining , question answering , and other information retrieval tasks . In many applications that require such capability , applying traditional language modeling techniques to the stream of OCR text does not give satisfactory result due to the absence of linguistic context . We present an approach for extracting relevant named entities from document images by combining rich page layout features in the image space with language content in the OCR text using a discriminative conditional random field ( CRF ) framework . We integrate this named entity extraction engine into our expense reimbursement solution and evaluate the system performance on large collections of real-world receipt images provided by IBM World Wide Reimbursement Center .", "13824712": "Clustering with relative constraints . Recent studies have suggested using relative distance comparisons as constraints to represent domain knowledge . A natural extension to relative comparisons is the combination of two comparisons defined on the same set of three instances . Constraints in this form , termed Relative Constraints , provide a unified knowledge representation for both partitional and hierarchical clusterings . But many key properties of relative constraints remain unknown . In this paper , we answer the following important questions that enable the broader application of relative constraints in general clustering problems : '' Feasibility : Does there exist a clustering that satisfies a given set of relative constraints ? ( consistency of constraints ) `` Completeness : Given a set of consistent relative constraints , how can one derive a complete clustering without running into dead-ends ? '' Informativeness : How can one extract the most informative relative constraints from given knowledge sources ? We show that any hierarchical domain knowledge can be easily represented by relative constraints . We further present a hierarchical algorithm that finds a clustering satisfying all given constraints in polynomial time . Experiments showed that our algorithm achieves significantly higher accuracy than the existing metric learning approach based on relative comparisons .", "839336": "Distributed data mining in a chain store database of short transactions . In this paper , we broaden the horizon of traditional rule mining by introducing a new framework of causality rule mining in a distributed chain store database . Specifically , the causality rule explored in this paper consists of a sequence of triggering events and a set of consequential events , and is designed with the capability of mining non-sequential , inter-transaction information . Hence , the causality rule mining provides a very general framework for rule derivation . Note , however , that the procedure of causality rule mining is very costly particularly in the presence of a huge number of candidate sets and a distributed database , and in our opinion , can not be dealt with by direct extensions from existing rule mining methods . Consequently , we devise in this paper a series of level matching algorithms , including Level Matching ( abbreviatedly as LM ) , Level Matching with Selective Scan ( abbreviatedly as LMS ) , and Distributed Level Matching ( abbreviatedly as Distibuted LM ) , to minimize the computing cost needed for the distributed data mining of causality rules . In addition , the phenomena of time window constraints are also taken into consideration for the development of our algorithms . As a result of properly employing the technologies of level matching and selective scan , the proposed algorithms present good efficiency and scalability in the mining of local and global causality rules .

Hewlett-Packard has many millions of technical support documents in a variety of collections . As part of content management , such collections are periodically merged and groomed .

Doing so improves the quality of the collection , eliminates chaff from search results , and improves customer satisfaction . The technical challenge is that through workflow and human processes , the knowledge of which documents are related is often lost . We required a method that could identify similar documents based on their content alone , without relying on metadata , which may be corrupt or missing . We present an approach for finding similar files that scales up to large document repositories .

Syslog monitoring technologies have recently received vast attentions in the areas of network management and network monitoring .

Syslogs are intrinsically dynamic in the sense that they form a time series and that their behavior may change over time . This paper proposes a new methodology of dynamic syslog mining in order to detect failure symptoms with higher confidence and to discover sequential alarm patterns among computer devices . The key ideas of dynamic syslog mining are 1 ) to represent syslog behavior using a mixture of Hidden Markov Models , 2 ) to adaptively learn the model using an on-line discounting learning algorithm in combination with dynamic selection of the optimal number of mixture components , and 3 ) to give anomaly scores using universal test statistics with a dynamically optimized threshold .

Using this multilevel framework , we propose a new kind of graph clustering for data reduction of very large graph systems such as social , biological , or electronic networks .

We propose a new method for detecting patterns of anomalies in categorical datasets . We assume that anomalies are generated by some underlying process which affects only a particular subset of the data . Our method consists of two steps : we first use a `` local anomaly detector '' to identify individual records with anomalous attribute values , and then detect patterns where the number of anomalous records is higher than expected . Given the set of anomalies flagged by the local anomaly detector , we search over all subsets of the data defined by any set of fixed values of a subset of the attributes , in order to detect self-similar patterns of anomalies . We wish to detect any such subset of the test data which displays a significant increase in anomalous activity as compared to the normal behavior of the system ( as indicated by the training data ) . We perform significance testing to determine if the number of anomalies in any subset of the test data is significantly higher than expected , and propose an efficient algorithm to perform this test over all such subsets of the data . We show that this algorithm is able to accurately detect anomalous patterns in real-world hospital , container shipping and network intrusion data .", "14156740": "Fast coordinate descent methods with variable selection for non-negative matrix factorization . Nonnegative Matrix Factorization ( NMF ) is an effective dimension reduction method for non-negative dyadic data , and has proven to be useful in many areas , such as text mining , bioinformatics and image processing . NMF is usually formulated as a constrained non-convex optimization problem , and many algorithms have been developed for solving it . Recently , a coordinate descent method , called FastHals , has been proposed to solve least squares NMF and is regarded as one of the state-of-the-art techniques for the problem . In this paper , we first show that FastHals has an inefficiency in that it uses a cyclic coordinate descent scheme and thus , performs unneeded descent steps on unimportant variables . We then present a variable selection scheme that uses the gradient of the objective function to arrive at a new coordinate descent method . Our new method is considerably faster in practice and we show that it has theoretical convergence guarantees . Moreover when the solution is sparse , as is often the case in real applications , our new method benefits by selecting important variables to update more often , thus resulting in higher speed . As an example , on a text dataset RCV1 , our method is 7 times faster than FastHals , and more than 15 times faster when the sparsity is increased by adding an L1 penalty . We also develop new coordinate descent methods when error in NMF is measured by KL-divergence by applying the Newton method to solve the one-variable sub-problems . Experiments indicate that our algorithm for minimizing the KL-divergence is faster than the Lee & Seung multiplicative rule by a factor of 10 on the CBCL image dataset .", "1063961": "A cross-collection mixture model for comparative text mining . In this paper , we define and study a novel text mining problem , which we refer to as Comparative Text Mining ( CTM ) .

This general problem subsumes many interesting applications , including business intelligence and opinion summarization . We propose a generative probabilistic mixture model for comparative text mining . The model simultaneously performs cross-collection clustering and within-collection clustering , and can be applied to an arbitrary set of comparable text collections . The model can be estimated efficiently using the Expectation-Maximization ( EM ) algorithm . We evaluate the model on two different text data sets ( i.e. , a news article data set and a laptop review data set ) , and compare it with a baseline clustering method also based on a mixture model .

Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the quantity of image data collected , due to advances in fields such as medical imaging , reconnaissance , surveillance , astronomy , multimedia etc. . With this increase has come the need to be able to store , transmit , and query large volumes of image data efficiently . A common operation on image databases is the retrieval of all images that are similar to a query image . For this , the images in the database are often represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space and a query is answered by retrieving all image vectors that are proximal to the query image in this space , under a suitable similarity metric . To overcome problems associated with high dimensionality , such as high storage and retrieval times , a dimension reduction step is usually applied to the vectors to concentrate relevant information in a small number of dimensions . Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) is a well-known dimension reduction scheme . However , since it works with vectorized representations of images , PCA does not take into account the spatial locality of pixels in images . In this paper , a new dimension reduction scheme , called Generalized Principal Component Analysis ( GPCA ) , is presented . This scheme works directly with images in their native state , as two-dimensional matrices , by projecting the images to a vector space that is the tensor product of two lower-dimensional vector spaces . Experiments on databases of face images show that , for the same amount of storage , GPCA is superior to PCA in terms of quality of the compressed images , query precision , and computational cost .", "1835216": "Efficient decision tree construction on streaming data .

The task of linking databases is an important step in an increasing number of data mining projects , because linked data can contain information that is not available otherwise , or that would require time-consuming and expensive collection of specific data . The aim of linking is to match and aggregate all records that refer to the same entity . One of the major challenges when linking large databases is the efficient and accurate classification of record pairs into matches and non-matches . While traditionally classification was based on manually-set thresholds or on statistical procedures , many of the more recently developed classification methods are based on supervised learning techniques . They therefore require training data , which is often not available in real world situations or has to be prepared manually , an expensive , cumbersome and time-consuming process . The author has previously presented a novel two-step approach to automatic record pair classification ( 6 , 7 ) . In the first step of this approach , training examples of high quality are automatically selected from the compared record pairs , and used in the second step to train a support vector machine ( SVM ) classifier . Initial experiments showed the feasibility of the approach , achieving results that outperformed k-means clustering . In this paper , two variations of this approach are presented . The first is based on a nearest-neighbour classifier , while the second improves a SVM classifier by iteratively adding more examples into the training sets . Experimental results show that this two-step approach can achieve better classification results than other unsupervised approaches .", "13676844": "Systematic data selection to mine concept-drifting data streams . One major problem of existing methods to mine data streams is that it makes ad hoc choices to combine most recent data with some amount of old data to search the new hypothesis . The assumption is that the additional old data always helps produce a more accurate hypothesis than using the most recent data only . We first criticize this notion and point out that using old data blindly is not better than `` gambling '' ; in other words , it helps increase the accuracy only if we are `` lucky . '' We discuss and analyze the situations where old data will help and what kind of old data will help . The practical problem on choosing the right example from old data is due to the formidable cost to compare different possibilities and models . This problem will go away if we have an algorithm that is extremely efficient to compare all sensible choices with little extra cost .

We introduce an interaction-based metric for estimating a user 's affinity to his contacts and groups . We then describe a novel friend suggestion algorithm that uses a user 's implicit social graph to generate a friend group , given a small seed set of contacts which the user has already labeled as friends .

We introduce multiple topic tracking ( MTT ) for iScore to better recommend news articles for users with multiple interests and to address changes in user interests over time .

Focusing on only interesting topics enables iScore to discard useless profiles to address changes in user interests and to achieve a balance between resource consumption and classification accuracy . Also by relating a topic 's interestingness to an article . s interestingness , iScore is able to achieve higher quality results than traditional methods such as the Rocchio algorithm . We identify several operating parameters that work well for MTT . Using the same parameters , we show that MTT alone yields high quality results for recommending interesting articles from several corpora . The inclusion of MTT improves iScore 's performance by 9 % in recommending news articles from the Yahoo ! News RSS feeds and the TREC11 adaptive filter article collection . And through a small user study , we show that iScore can still perform well when only provided with little user feedback ."}
