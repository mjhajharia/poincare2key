{"9770011": "Anycast-aware transport for content delivery networks . Anycast-based content delivery networks ( CDNs ) have many properties that make them ideal for the large scale distribution of content on the Internet . However , because routing changes can result in a change of the endpoint that terminates the TCP session , TCP session disruption remains a concern for anycast CDNs , especially for large file downloads . In this paper we demonstrate that this problem does not require any complex solutions . In particular , we present the design of a simple , yet efficient , mechanism to handle session disruptions due to endpoint changes . With our mechanism , a client can continue the download of the content from the point at which it was before the endpoint change . Furthermore , CDN servers purge the TCP connection state quickly to handle frequent switching with low system overhead . We demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism and show that more complex mechanisms are not required . Specifically , we find that our mechanism maintains high download throughput even with a reasonably high rate of endpoint switching , which is attractive for load balancing scenarios . Moreover , our results show that edge servers can purge TCP connection state after a single timeout-triggered retransmission without any tangible impact on ongoing connections . Besides improving server performance , this behavior improves the resiliency of the CDN to certain denial of service attacks .", "4434023": "Adaptive web sites : user studies and simulation .

Online social networking sites like MySpace , Facebook , and Flickr have become a popular way to share and disseminate content .

However , there is little data publicly available on viral propagation in the real world and few studies have characterized how information spreads over current online social networks . In this paper , we collect and analyze large-scale traces of information dissemination in the Flickr social network .

( b ) how quickly does information propagate ? and ( c ) what is the role of word-of-mouth exchanges between friends in the overall propagation of information in the network ? Contrary to viral marketing `` intuition , '' we find that ( a ) even popular photos do not spread widely throughout the network , ( b ) even popular photos spread slowly through the network , and ( c ) information exchanged between friends is likely to account for over 50 of all favorite-markings , but with a significant delay at each hop .", "4301483": "On anonymizing query logs via token-based hashing .

Screen readers , the dominant assistive technology used by visually impaired people to access the Web , function by speaking out the content of the screen serially . Using screen readers for conducting online transactions can cause considerable information overload , because transactions , such as shopping and paying bills , typically involve a number of steps spanning several web pages . One can combat this overload by using a transaction model for web accessibility that presents only fragments of web pages that are needed for doing transactions . We can realize such a model by coupling a process automaton , encoding states of a transaction , with concept classifiers that identify page fragments `` relevant '' to a particular state of the transaction . In this paper we present a fully automated process that synergistically combines several techniques for transforming unlabeled click-stream data generated by transactions into a transactionmodel . These techniques include web content analysis to partition a web page into segments consisting of semantically related content , contextual analysis of data surrounding clickable objects in a page , and machine learning methods , such as clustering of page segments based on contextual analysis , statistical classification , and automata learning . The use of unlabeled click streams in building transaction models has important benefits : ( i ) visually impaired users do not have to depend on sighted users for creating manually labeled training data to construct the models ; ( ii ) it is possible to mine personalized models from unlabeled transaction click-streams associated with sites that visually impaired users visit regularly ; ( iii ) since unlabeled data is relatively easy to obtain , it is feasible to scale up the construction of domain-specific transaction models ( e.g. , separate models for shopping , airline reservations , bill payments , etc. ) ; ( iv ) adjusting the performance of deployed models over timtime with new training data is also doable . We provide preliminary experimental evidence of the practical effectiveness of both domain-specific , as well as personalized accessibility transaction models built using our approach .

This paper presents a systematic study of the properties of a large number of Web sites hosted by a major ISP . To our knowledge , ours is the first comprehensive study of a large server farm that contains thousands of commercial Web sites . We also perform a simulation analysis to estimate potential performance benefits of content delivery networks ( CDNs ) for these Web sites . We make several interesting observations about the current usage of Web technologies and Web site performance characteristics . First , compared with previous client workload studies , the Web server farm workload contains a much higher degree of uncacheable responses and responses that require mandatory cache validations . A significant reason for this is that cookie use is prevalent among our population , especially among more popular sites . However , we found an indication of wide-spread indiscriminate usage of cookies , which unnecessarily impedes the use of many content delivery optimizations . We also found that most Web sites do not utilize the cache-control features ofthe HTTP 1.1 protocol , resulting in suboptimal performance . Moreover , the implicit expiration time in client caches for responses is constrained by the maximum values allowed in the Squid proxy . Finally , our simulation results indicate that most Web sites benefit from the use of a CDN . The amount of the benefit depends on site popularity , and , somewhat surprisingly , a CDN may increase the peak to average request ratio at the origin server because the CDN can decrease the average request rate more than the peak request rate .", "93076": "Ranking the web frontier .

Continuous queries are used to monitor changes to time varying data and to provide results useful for online decision making . Typically a user desires to obtain the value of some aggregation function over distributed data items , for example , to know ( a ) the average of temperatures sensed by a set of sensors ( b ) the value of index of mid-cap stocks . In these queries a client specifies a coherency requirement as part of the query . In this paper we present a low-cost , scalable technique to answer continuous aggregation queries using a content distribution network of dynamic data items . In such a network of data aggregators , each data aggregator serves a set of data items at specific coherencies . Just as various fragments of a dynamic web-page are served by one or more nodes of a content distribution network , our technique involves decomposing a client query into sub-queries and executing sub-queries on judiciously chosen data aggregators with their individual sub-query incoherency bounds . We provide a technique of getting the optimal query plan ( i.e. , set of sub-queries and their chosen data aggregators ) which satisfies client query . s coherency requirement with least cost , measured in terms of the number of refresh messages sent from aggregators to the client . For estimating query execution cost , we build a continuous query cost model which can be used to estimate the number of messages required to satisfy the client specified incoherency bound . Performance results using real-world traces show that our cost based query planning leads to queries being executed using less than one third the number of messages required by existing schemes .", "9919614": "What is Twitter , a social network or a news media ? . Twitter , a microblogging service less than three years old , commands more than 41 million users as of July 2009 and is growing fast . Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets . The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing . We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles , 1.47 billion social relations , 4,262 trending topics , and 106 million tweets . In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution , a short effective diameter , and low reciprocity , which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks ( 28 ) . In order to identify influentials on Twitter , we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar . Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings , indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one 's tweets . We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation . We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority ( over 85 % ) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature . A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet .

Modern day federated search engines aggregate heterogeneous types of results from multiple vertical search engines and compose a single search engine result page ( SERP ) .

The usual way to compare two ranking algorithms is to first fix their operating points ( internal thresholds ) , and then run an online experiment that lasts multiple weeks . Online user engagement metrics are then compared to decide which algorithm is better . However , this method does not characterize and compare the behavior over the entire span of operating points . Furthermore , this time-consuming approach is not practical if we have to conduct the experiment over numerous operating points .

Cellular networks employ a specific radio resource management policy distinguishing them from wired and Wi-Fi networks . A lack of awareness of this important mechanism potentially leads to resource-inefficient mobile applications . We perform the first network-wide , large-scale investigation of a particular type of application traffic pattern called periodic transfers where a handset periodically exchanges some data with a remote server every t seconds . Using packet traces containing 1.5 billion packets collected from a commercial cellular carrier , we found that periodic transfers are very prevalent in today 's smartphone traffic . However , they are extremely resource-inefficient for both the network and end-user devices even though they predominantly generate very little traffic . This somewhat counter-intuitive behavior is a direct consequence of the adverse interaction between such periodic transfer patterns and the cellular network radio resource management policy . For example , for popular smartphone applications such as Facebook , periodic transfers account for only 1.7 % of the overall traffic volume but contribute to 30 % of the total handset radio energy consumption . We found periodic transfers are generated for various reasons such as keep-alive , polling , and user behavior measurements .

In particular , we elaborate on novel techniques such as streamed extraction of mapped source values and scalable disk-based merging of overlapping data ( including duplicate elimination ) . We compare our transformation framework with alternative methods such as using XQuery or SQL\\/XML provided by current commercial databases . The results demonstrate that the three-phase framework ( although as simple as it is ) is highly scalable and outperforms the alternative methods by orders of magnitude .", "11619605": "Alhambra : a system for creating , enforcing , and testing browser security policies . Alhambra is a browser-based system designed to enforce and test web browser security policies . At the core of Alhambra is a policy-enhanced browser supporting fine-grain security policies that restrict web page contents and execution . Alhambra requires no server-side modifications or additions to the web application . Policies can restrict the construction of the document as well as the execution of JavaScript using access control rules and a taint-tracking engine . Using the Alhambra browser , we present two security policies that we have built using our architecture , both designed to prevent cross-site scripting . The first policy uses a taint-tracking engine to prevent cross-site scripting attacks that exploit bugs in the client-side of the web applications . The second one uses browsing history to create policies that restrict the contents of documents and prevent the inclusion of malicious content . Using Alhambra we analyze the impact of policies on the compatibility of web pages . To test compatibility , Alhambra supports revisiting user-generated browsing sessions and comparing multiple security policies in parallel to quickly and automatically evaluate security policies . To compare security policies for identical pages we have also developed useful comparison metrics that quantify differences between identical pages executed with different security policies . Not only do we show that our policies are effective with minimal compatibility cost , we also demonstrate that Alhambra can enforce strong security policies and provide quantitative evaluation of the differences introduced by security policies .", "4422411": "Causal relation of queries from temporal logs . In this paper , we study a new problem of mining causal relation of queries in search engine query logs . Causal relation between two queries means event on one query is the causation of some event on the other . We first detect events in query logs by efficient statistical frequency threshold . Then the causal relation of queries is mined by the geometric features of the events . Finally the Granger Causality Test ( GCT ) is utilized to further re-rank the causal relation of queries according to their GCT coefficients . In addition , we develop a 2-dimensional visualization tool to display the detected relationship of events in a more intuitive way . The experimental results on the MSN search engine query logs demonstrate that our approach can accurately detect the events in temporal query logs and the causal relation of queries is detected effectively .", "13507543": "A class-feature-centroid classifier for text categorization . Automated text categorization is an important technique for many web applications , such as document indexing , document filtering , and cataloging web resources . Many different approaches have been proposed for the automated text categorization problem . Among them , centroid-based approaches have the advantages of short training time and testing time due to its computational efficiency . As a result , centroid-based classifiers have been widely used in many web applications . However , the accuracy of centroid-based classifiers is inferior to SVM , mainly because centroids found during construction are far from perfect locations . We design a fast Class-Feature-Centroid ( CFC ) classifier for multi-class , single-label text categorization . In CFC , a centroid is built from two important class distributions : inter-class term index and inner-class term index . CFC proposes a novel combination of these indices and employs a denormalized cosine measure to calculate the similarity score between a text vector and a centroid . Experiments on the Reuters-21578 corpus and 20-newsgroup email collection show that CFC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art SVM classifiers on both micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores . Particularly , CFC is more effective and robust than SVM when data is sparse .", "4443752": "Generation of multimedia TV news contents for WWW .

An important trend in Web information processing is the support of multimedia retrieval .

In this paper , an aggressive search mechanism called Octopus is proposed which addresses the retrieval of multi-modality data using multifaceted knowledge . In particular , Octopus promotes a novel scenario in which the user supplies seed objects of arbitrary modality as the hint of his information need , and receives a set of multi-modality objects satisfying his need . The foundation of Octopus is a multifaceted knowledge base constructed on a layered graph model ( LGM ) , which describes the relevance between media objects from various perspectives .

Such VPNs are implemented using a diverse set of technologies such as Frame Relay , MPLS , or IPSEC to achieve the goal of privacy and performance isolation from the public Internet . Using VPNs to distribute live content has recently received tremendous interest . For example , a VPN could be used to broadcast a CEO-employee town hall meeting .

In this paper , we address the problem of optimally placing such streaming splitters or caches to broadcast to a given set of VPN endpoints under the constraints typically found within a VPN . In particular , we introduce an efficient algorithm with complexity O ( V ) , V being the number of routers in the VPN . This guarantees the optimal cache placement if interception is used for redirection . We prove that the general problem is NP-hard and introduce multiple heuristics for efficient and robust cache placement suitable under different constraints .

In many social computing applications such as online Q&A forums , the best contribution for each task receives some high reward , while all remaining contributions receive an identical , lower reward irrespective of their actual qualities . Suppose a mechanism designer ( site owner ) wishes to optimize an objective that is some function of the number and qualities of received contributions . When potential contributors are { \\ em strategic } agents , who decide whether to contribute or not to selfishly maximize their own utilities , is such a `` best contribution '' mechanism , Mb , adequate to implement an outcome that is optimal for the mechanism designer ? We first show that in settings where a contribution 's value is determined primarily by an agent 's expertise , and agents only strategically choose whether to contribute or not , contests can implement optimal outcomes : for any reasonable objective , the rewards for the best and remaining contributions in Mb can always be chosen so that the outcome in the unique symmetric equilibrium of Mb maximizes the mechanism designer 's utility . We also show how the mechanism designer can learn these optimal rewards when she does not know the parameters of the agents ' utilities , as might be the case in practice . We next consider settings where a contribution 's value depends on both the contributor 's expertise as well as her effort , and agents endogenously choose how much effort to exert in addition to deciding whether to contribute . Here , we show that optimal outcomes can never be implemented by contests if the system can rank the qualities of contributions perfectly .

One immediate challenge in searching the deep web databases is source selection - i.e. selecting the most relevant web databases for answering a given query . The existing database selection methods ( both text and relational ) assess the source quality based on the query-similarity-based relevance assessment . When applied to the deep web these methods have two deficiencies . First is that the methods are agnostic to the correctness ( trustworthiness ) of the sources . Secondly , the query based relevance does not consider the importance of the results . These two considerations are essential for the open collections like the deep web . Since a number of sources provide answers to any query , we conjuncture that the agreements between these answers are likely to be helpful in assessing the importance and the trustworthiness of the sources . We compute the agreement between the sources as the agreement of the answers returned . While computing the agreement , we also measure and compensate for possible collusion between the sources . This adjusted agreement is modeled as a graph with sources at the vertices . On this agreement graph , a quality score of a source that we call SourceRank , is calculated as the stationary visit probability of a random walk . We evaluate SourceRank in multiple domains , including sources in Google Base , with sizes up to 675 sources . We demonstrate that the SourceRank tracks source corruption .

Unfortunately subtle interactions between P3P and APPEL result in serious problems when using APPEL : Users can only directly specify what is unacceptable in a policy , not what is acceptable ; simple preferences are hard to express ; and writing APPEL preferences is error prone . We show that these problems follow from a fundamental design choice made by APPEL , and can not be solved without completely redesigning the language . Therefore we explore alternatives to APPEL that can overcome these problems . In particular , we show that XPath serves quite nicely as a preference language and solves all the above problems . We identify the minimal subset of XPath that is needed , thus allowing matching programs to potentially use a smaller memory footprint .

Current state-of-the-art solutions are able to do co-browsing of `` static web pages '' , and do not support the synchronization of JavaScript interactions . However , currently many web pages use JavaScript and Ajax techniques to create highly dynamic and interactive web applications . In this paper , we describe two approaches for co-browsing that both support the synchronization of the JavaScript and Ajax interactions of dynamic web pages . One approach is based on synchronizing the output of the JavaScript engine by sending over the changes made on the DOM tree . The other approach is based on synchronizing the input of the JavaScript engine by synchronizing UI events and incoming data . Since the latter solution offers a better user experience and is more scalable , it is elaborated in more detail . An important aspect of both approaches is that they operate at the DOM level . Therefore , the client-side can be implemented in JavaScript and no browser extensions are required . To the best of the authors ' knowledge this is the first DOM-level co-browsing solution that also enables co-browsing of the dynamic interaction parts of web pages . The presented co-browsing solution has been implemented in a research demonstrator which allows users to do co-browsing of web-applications on browser-based networked televisions .", "4469495": "EPCI : extracting potentially copyright infringement texts from the web .

We consider the problem of identifying the consensus ranking for the results of a query , given preferences among those results from a set of individual users . Once consensus rankings are identified for a set of queries , these rankings can serve for both evaluation and training of retrieval and learning systems . We present a novel approach to collecting the individual user preferences over image-search results : we use a collaborative game in which players are rewarded for agreeing on which image result is best for a query . Our approach is distinct from other labeling games because we are able to elicit directly the preferences of interest with respect to image queries extracted from query logs . As a source of relevance judgments , this data provides a useful complement to click data . Furthermore , the data is free of positional biases and is collected by the game without the risk of frustrating users with non-relevant results ; this risk is prevalent in standard mechanisms for debiasing clicks . We describe data collected over 34 days from a deployed version of this game that amounts to about 18 million expressed preferences between pairs .

Service-Oriented Computing ( SOC ) enables the composition of loosely coupled services provided with varying Quality of Service ( QoS ) levels . Selecting a ( near - ) optimal set of services for a composition in terms of QoS is crucial when many functionally equivalent services are available . With the advent of Cloud Computing , both the number of such services and their distribution across the network are rising rapidly , increasing the impact of the network on the QoS of such compositions . Despite this , current approaches do not differentiate between the QoS of services themselves and the QoS of the network . Therefore , the computed latency differs substantially from the actual latency , resulting in suboptimal QoS for service compositions in the cloud . Thus , we propose a network-aware approach that handles the QoS of services and the QoS of the network independently . First , we build a network model in order to estimate the network latency between arbitrary services and potential users . Our selection algorithm then leverages this model to find compositions that will result in a low latency given an employed execution policy . In our evaluation , we show that our approach efficiently computes compositions with much lower latency than current approaches .", "39868": "A web middleware architecture for dynamic customization of content for wireless clients .

The aim of such queries is to `` extract '' relationships between entities i.e. paths from a data graph .

In Twitter , the locations of the tweets can be identified by the GPS locations from smart phones . Many interesting concepts , including cultures , scenes , and product sales , correspond to specialized geographical distributions . In this paper , we are interested in two questions : ( 1 ) how to discover different topics of interests that are coherent in geographical regions ?

To make a fair comparison , we collect several representative datasets from Flickr website including Landscape , Activity , Manhattan , National park , Festival , Car , and Food . The results show that the first two methods work in some datasets but fail in others . LGTA works well in all these datasets at not only finding regions of interests but also providing effective comparisons of the topics across different locations .

Our research is highlighted in the following location-related queries in our daily life : 1 ) if we want to do something such as sightseeing or food-hunting in a large city such as Beijing , where should we go ? 2 ) If we have already visited some places such as the Bird 's Nest building in Beijing 's Olympic park , what else can we do there ?

Bucket testing , also known as split testing , A\\/B testing , or 0\\/1 testing , is a widely used method for evaluating users ' satisfaction with new features , products , or services . In order not to expose the whole user base to the new service , the mean user satisfaction rate is estimated by exposing the service only to a few uniformly chosen random users . In a recent work , Backstrom and Kleinberg , defined the notion of network bucket testing for social services . In this context , users ' interactions are only valid for measurement if some minimal number of their friends are also given the service . The goal is to estimate the mean user satisfaction rate while providing the service to the least number of users . This constraint makes uniform sampling , which is optimal for the traditional case , grossly inefficient .

Given an algorithm , the framework produces an unbiased user satisfaction rate estimator and a corresponding variance bound for any network and any user satisfaction function .

This paper introduces a framework for modeling and specifying the global behavior of e-service compositions . Under this framework , peers ( individual e-services ) communicate through asynchronous messages and each peer maintains a queue for incoming messages . A global `` watcher '' keeps track of messages as they occur . We propose and study a central notion of a `` conversation '' , which is a sequence of ( classes of ) messages observed by the watcher . We consider the case where the peers are represented by Mealy machines ( finite state machines with input and output ) . The sets of conversations exhibit unexpected behaviors . For example , there exists a composite e-service based on Mealy peers whose set of conversations is not context free ( and not regular ) . ( The set of conversations is always context sensitive . ) One cause for this is the queuing of messages ; we introduce an operator `` prepone '' that simulates queue delays from a global perspective and show that the set of conversations of each Mealy e-service is closed under prepone . We illustrate that the global prepone fails to completely capture the queue delay effects and refine prepone to a `` local '' version on conversations seen by individual peers . On the other hand , Mealy implementations of a composite e-service will always generate conversations whose `` projections '' are consistent with individual e-services . We use projection-join to reflect such situations . However , there are still Mealy peers whose set of conversations is not the local prepone and projection-join closure of any regular language . Therefore , we propose conversation specifications as a formalism to define the conversations allowed by an e-service composition . We give two technical results concerning the interplay between the local behaviors of Mealy peers and the global behaviors of their compositions . One result shows that for each regular language , its local prepone and projection-join closure corresponds to the set of conversations by some Mealy peers effectively constructed from . The second result gives a condition on the shape of a composition which guarantees that the set of conversations that can be realized is the local prepone and projection-join closure of a regular language .", "247234": "The indexable web is more than 11.5 billion pages .

In contrast , our concept allows a wide range of diverse business transaction patterns necessary for industry supply chains . An industry develops a standard SCM model that partitions the whole supply chain into several transaction segments , each of which provides alternative business transaction patterns . For B2B collaboration , companies must agree on a collaboration configuration , which chooses the transaction alternatives from each segment . To support the development of a B2B system that executes an agreed collaboration , we introduce an SOA ( service oriented architecture ) based pattern called a distributed hub architecture . As a hub of B2B collaboration , it includes a complete set of services that can process every possible business transaction included in a standard SCM model . However , it does not function as a centralized service that coordinates participants . Instead , it is deployed on every participant and executes the assigned part of the supply chain collaboratively with other distributed hubs .

We thus develop faceted interface discovery algorithms that optimize the ranking metrics .

Our proposed algorithm generates a concise structured set of documents maximizing coverage of salient pieces of information . Most importantly , metro maps explicitly show the relations among retrieved pieces in a way that captures story development . We first formalize characteristics of good maps and formulate their construction as an optimization problem . Then we provide efficient methods with theoretical guarantees for generating maps .

In this paper , we address the problem of database selection for XML document collections , that is , given a set of collections and a user query , how to rank the collections based on their goodness to the query . Goodness is determined by the relevance of the documents in the collection to the query . We consider keyword queries and support Lowest Common Ancestor ( LCA ) semantics for defining query results , where the relevance of each document to a query is determined by properties of the LCA of those nodes in the XML document that contain the query keywords . To avoid evaluating queries against each document in a collection , we propose maintaining in a preprocessing phase , information about the LCAs of all pairs of keywords in a document and use it to approximate the properties of the LCA-based results of a query . To improve storage and processing efficiency , we use appropriate summaries of the LCA information based on Bloom filters .

We propose a context-sensitive query auto completion algorithm , NearestCompletion , which outputs the completions of the user 's input that are most similar to the context queries . To measure similarity , we represent queries and contexts as high-dimensional term-weighted vectors and resort to cosine similarity . The mapping from queries to vectors is done through a new query expansion technique that we introduce , which expands a query by traversing the query recommendation tree rooted at the query . In order to evaluate our approach , we performed extensive experimentation over the public AOL query log . We demonstrate that when the recent user 's queries are relevant to the current query she is typing , then after typing a single character , NearestCompletion 's MRR is 48 % higher relative to the MRR of the standard MostPopularCompletion algorithm on average . When the context is irrelevant , however , NearestCompletion 's MRR is essentially zero . To mitigate this problem , we propose HybridCompletion , which is a hybrid of NearestCompletion with MostPopularCompletion . HybridCompletion is shown to dominate both NearestCompletion and MostPopularCompletion , achieving a total improvement of 31.5 % in MRR relative to MostPopularCompletion on average .", "4522493": "Image annotation using search and mining technologies .

The explosion of Web opinion data has made essential the need for automatic tools to analyze and understand people 's sentiments toward different topics .

However , it is well known that there is no universally optimal sentiment lexicon since the polarity of words is sensitive to the topic domain . Even worse , in the same domain the same word may indicate different polarities with respect to different aspects . For example , in a laptop review , `` large '' is negative for the battery aspect while being positive for the screen aspect .

We propose a novel optimization framework that provides a unified and principled way to combine different sources of information for learning such a context-dependent sentiment lexicon .

Ironically , almost all template engines allow violation of this separation principle , which is the very impetus for HTML template engine development . This situation is due mostly to a lack of formal definition of separation and fear that enforcing separation emasculates a template 's power . I show that not only is strict separation a worthy design principle , but that we can enforce separation while providing a potent template engine . I demonstrate my StringTemplate engine , used to build jGuru.com and other commercial sites , at work solving some nontrivial generational tasks . My goal is to formalize the study of template engines , thus , providing a common nomenclature , a means of classifying template generational power , and a way to leverage interesting results from formal language theory . I classify three types of restricted templates analogous to Chomsky 's type 1 . .3 grammar classes and formally define separation including the rules that embody separation . Because this paper provides a clear definition of model-view separation , template engine designers may no longer blindly claim enforcement of separation . Moreover , given theoretical arguments and empirical evidence , programmers no longer have an excuse to entangle model and view .", "13502389": "Search shortcuts : driving users towards their goals .

Implementing successful rural computing applications requires addressing a number of significant challenges . Recent advances in mobile phone computing capabilities make this device a likely candidate to address the client hardware constraints . Long battery life , wireless connectivity , solid-state memory , low price and immediate utility all make it better suited to rural conditions than a PC . However , current mobile software platforms are not as appropriate . Web-based mobile applications are hard to use , do not take advantage of the mobile phone 's media capabilities and require an online connection . Custom mobile applications are difficult to develop and distribute . To address these limitations we present CAM - a new framework for developing and deploying mobile computing applications in the rural developing world . CAM applications are accessed by capturing barcodes using the mobile phone camera , or entering numeric strings with the keypad . Supporting minimal navigation , direct linkage to paper practices and offline multi-media interaction , CAM is uniquely adapted to rural device , user and infrastructure constraints . To illustrate the breadth of the framework , we list a number of CAM-based applications that we have implemented or are planning .

Crowdsourcing is a new Web phenomenon , in which a firm takes a function once performed in-house and outsources it to a crowd , usually in the form of an open contest . Designing efficient crowdsourcing mechanisms is not possible without deep understanding of incentives and strategic choices of all participants . This paper presents an empirical analysis of determinants of individual performance in multiple simultaneous crowdsourcing contests using a unique dataset for the world 's largest competitive software development portal : TopCoder.com . Special attention is given to studying the effects of the reputation system currently used by TopCoder.com on behavior of contestants . We find that individual specific traits together with the project payment and the number of project requirements are significant predictors of the final project quality . Furthermore , we find significant evidence of strategic behavior of contestants . High rated contestants face tougher competition from their opponents in the competition phase of the contest . In order to soften the competition , they move first in the registration phase of the contest , signing up early for particular projects . Although registration in TopCoder contests is non-binding , it deters entry of opponents in the same contest ; our lower bound estimate shows that this strategy generates significant surplus gain to high rated contestants . We conjecture that the reputation + cheap talk mechanism employed by TopCoder has a positive effect on allocative efficiency of simultaneous all-pay contests and should be considered for adoption in other crowdsourcing platforms .", "680590": "Summarizing email conversations with clue words .

The second novelty is to use clue words to measure the importance of sentences in conversation summarization . Based on clue words and their scores , we propose a method called CWS , which is capable of producing a summary of any length as requested by the user .

We investigate the change of various attributes of loan requesting listings over time , such as the interest rate and the number of bids . We observe that there is herding behavior during bidding , and for most of the listings , the numbers of bids they receive reach spikes at very similar time points . We explain these phenomena by showing that there are economic and social factors that lenders take into account when deciding to bid on a listing . We also observe that the profits the lenders make are tied with their bidding preferences .

As opposed to earlier work , our tool-set handles rich data manipulation via XPath expressions . This allows us to verify designs at a more detailed level and check properties about message content . We present a framework where BPEL specifications of web services are translated to an intermediate representation , followed by the translation of the intermediate representation to a verification language . As an intermediate representation we use guarded automata augmented with unbounded queues for incoming messages , where the guards are expressed as XPath expressions .

We show that if a composite web service is synchronizable , then its conversation set remains same when asynchronous communication is replaced with synchronous communication .

Aliasing occurs in Web transactions when requests containing different URLs elicit replies containing identical data payloads . Conventional caches associate stored data with URLs and can therefore suffer redundant payload transfers due to aliasing and other causes . Existing research literature , however , says little about the prevalence of aliasing in user-initiated transactions , or about redundant payload transfers in conventional Web cache hierarchies . This paper quantifies the extent of aliasing and the performance impact of URL-indexed cache management using a large client trace from WebTV Networks . Fewer than 5 % of reply payloads are aliased ( referenced via multiple URLs ) but over 54 % of successful transactions involve aliased payloads . Aliased payloads account for under 3.1 % of the trace 's `` working set size '' ( sum of payload sizes ) but over 36 % of bytes transferred . For the WebTV workload , roughly 10 % of payload transfers to browser caches and 23 % of payload transfers to a shared proxy are redundant , assuming infinite-capacity conventional caches . Our analysis of a large proxy trace from Compaq Corporation yields similar results.URL-indexed caching does not entirely explain the large number of redundant proxy-to-browser payload transfers previously reported in the WebTV system . We consider other possible causes of redundant transfers ( e.g. , reply metadata and browser cache management policies ) and discuss a simple hop-by-hop protocol extension that completely eliminates all redundant transfers , regardless of cause .", "3713227": "Navigationaided retrieval .

NAR is a generalization of the conventional probabilistic information retrieval paradigm , which implicitly assumes no navigation takes place . This paper presents a formal model for navigation-aided retrieval , and reports empirical results that point to the real-world applicability of the model . The experiments were performed over a large Web corpus provided by TREC , using human judgments on a new rating scale developed for navigation-aided retrieval .

Users with poor connectivity may choose not to stay at a Web site if it takes a long time to receive a page , even if the Web server at the site is not the bottleneck . Retaining such clients may be of interest to a Web site . Better connected clients can receive enhanced representations of Web pages , such as with higher quality images . We explore a variety of considerations that could be used by a Web server in characterizing a client . Once a client is characterized as poor or rich , the server can deliver altered content , alter how content is delivered , alter policy and caching decisions , or decide when to redirect the client to a mirror site . We also use network-aware client clustering techniques to provide a coarser level of client categorization and use it to categorize subsequent clients from that cluster for which a client-specific categorization is not available . Our results for client characterization and applicable server actions are derived from real , recent , and diverse set of Web server logs . Our experiments demonstrate that a relatively simple characterization policy can classify poor clients such that these clients subsequently make the majority of badly performing requests to a Web server . This policy is also stable in terms of clients staying in the same class for a large portion of the analysis period . Client clustering can significantly help in initially classifying clients for which no previous information about the client is known . We also show that different server actions can be applied to a significant number of request sequences with poor performance .", "13064431": "Dynamic learning-based mechanism design for dependent valued exchange economies . Learning private information from multiple strategic agents poses challenge in many Internet applications . Sponsored search auctions , crowdsourcing , Amazon 's mechanical turk , various online review forums are examples where we are interested in learning true values of the advertisers or true opinion of the reviewers . The common thread in these decision problems is that the optimal outcome depends on the private information of all the agents , while the decision of the outcome can be chosen only through reported information which may be manipulated by the strategic agents . The other important trait of these applications is their dynamic nature . The advertisers in an online auction or the users of mechanical turk arrive and depart , and when present , interact with the system repeatedly , giving the opportunity to learn their types . Dynamic mechanisms , which learn from the past interactions and make present decisions depending on the expected future evolution of the game , has been shown to improve performance over repeated versions of static mechanisms . In this paper , we will survey the past and current state-of-the-art dynamic mechanisms and analyze a new setting where the agents consist of buyers and sellers , known as exchange economies , and agents having value interdependency , which are relevant in applications illustrated through examples . We show that known results of dynamic mechanisms with independent value settings can not guarantee certain desirable properties in this new significantly different setting .

An increasingly large amount of Web applications employ service objects such as Servlets to generate dynamic and personalized content . Existing caching infrastructures are not well suited for caching such content in mobile environments because of disconnection and weak connection . One possible approach to this problem is to replicate Web-related application logic to client devices . The challenges to this approach are to deal with client devices that exhibit huge divergence in resource availabilities , to support applications that have different data sharing and coherency requirements , and to accommodate the same application under different deployment environments . The Replet system targets these challenges . It uses client , server and application capability and preference information ( CPI ) to direct the replication of service objects to client devices : from the selection of a device for replication and populating the device with client-specific data , to choosing an appropriate replica to serve a given request and maintaining the desired state consistency among replicas . The Replet system exploits on-device replication to enable client - , server - and application-specific cost metrics for replica invocation and synchronization . We have implemented a prototype in the context of Servlet-based Web applications . Our experiment and simulation results demonstrate the viability and significant benefits of CPI-driven on-device service object replication .", "10461284": "Visualizing differences in web search algorithms using the expected weighted hoeffding distance . We introduce a new dissimilarity function for ranked lists , the expected weighted Hoeffding distance , that has several advantages over current dissimilarity measures for ranked search results . First , it is easily customized for users who pay varying degrees of attention to websites at different ranks . Second , unlike existing measures such as generalized Kendall 's tau , it is based on a true metric , preserving meaningful embeddings when visualization techniques like multi-dimensional scaling are applied . Third , our measure can effectively handle partial or missing rank information while retaining a probabilistic interpretation . Finally , the measure can be made computationally tractable and we give a highly efficient algorithm for computing it . We then apply our new metric with multi-dimensional scaling to visualize and explore relationships between the result sets from different search engines , showing how the weighted Hoeffding distance can distinguish important differences in search engine behavior that are not apparent with other rank-distance metrics . Such visualizations are highly effective at summarizing and analyzing insights on which search engines to use , what search strategies users can employ , and how search results evolve over time .

Mobile devices have already been widely used to access the Web .

In this paper , we propose a new browsing convention to facilitate navigation and reading on a small-form-factor device .

A page adaptation technique is also developed to analyze the structure of an existing web page and split it into small and logically related units that fit into the screen of a mobile device . For a web page not suitable for splitting , auto-positioning or scrolling-by-block is used to assist the browsing as an alterative .

Fully automatic methods that extract lists of objects from the Web have been studied extensively . Record extraction , the first step of this object extraction process , identifies a set of Web page segments , each of which represents an individual object ( e.g. , a product ) . State-of-the-art methods suffice for simple search , but they often fail to handle more complicated or noisy Web page structures due to a key limitation -- their greedy manner of identifying a list of records through pairwise comparison ( i.e. , similarity match ) of consecutive segments . This paper introduces a new method for record extraction that captures a list of objects in a more robust way based on a holistic analysis of a Web page . The method focuses on how a distinct tag path appears repeatedly in the DOM tree of the Web document . Instead of comparing a pair of individual segments , it compares a pair of tag path occurrence patterns ( called visual signals ) to estimate how likely these two tag paths represent the same list of objects . The paper introduces a similarity measure that captures how closely the visual signals appear and interleave . Clustering of tag paths is then performed based on this similarity measure , and sets of tag paths that form the structure of data records are extracted .

This functionality allows researchers to address an exciting set of questions : 1 ) How is information created and shared across geographical locations , 2 ) How do spatial and linguistic characteristics of people vary across regions , and 3 ) How to model human mobility . Although many attempts have been made for tackling these problems , previous methods are either complicated to be implemented or oversimplified that can not yield reasonable performance . It is a challenge task to discover topics and identify users ' interests from these geo-tagged messages due to the sheer amount of data and diversity of language variations used on these location sharing services . In this paper we focus on Twitter and present an algorithm by modeling diversity in tweets based on topical diversity , geographical diversity , and an interest distribution of the user . Furthermore , we take the Markovian nature of a user 's location into account . Our model exploits sparse factorial coding of the attributes , thus allowing us to deal with a large and diverse set of covariates efficiently . Our approach is vital for applications such as user profiling , content recommendation and topic tracking . We show high accuracy in location estimation based on our model . Moreover , the algorithm identifies interesting topics based on location and language .", "373164": "Improving Web search efficiency via a locality based static pruning method . The unarguably fast , and continuous , growth of the volume of indexed ( and indexable ) documents on the Web poses a great challenge for search engines . This is true regarding not only search effectiveness but also time and space efficiency . In this paper we present an index pruning technique targeted for search engines that addresses the latter issue without disconsidering the former . To this effect , we adopt a new pruning strategy capable of greatly reducing the size of search engine indices . Experiments using a real search engine show that our technique can reduce the indices ' storage costs by up to 60 % over traditional lossless compression methods , while keeping the loss in retrieval precision to a minimum . When compared to the indices size with no compression at all , the compression rate is higher than 88 % , i.e. , less than one eighth of the original size . More importantly , our results indicate that , due to the reduction in storage overhead , query processing time can be reduced to nearly 65 % of the original time , with no loss in average precision . The new method yields significative improvements when compared against the best known static pruning method for search engine indices . In addition , since our technique is orthogonal to the underlying search algorithms , it can be adopted by virtually any search engine .", "11931844": "Highly scalable web applications with zero-copy data transfer .

Internet server selection mechanisms attempt to optimize , subject to a variety of constraints , the distribution of client requests to a geographically and topologically diverse pool of servers . Research on server selection has thus far focused primarily on techniques for choosing a server from a group administered by single entity , like a content distribution network provider . In a federated , multi-provider computing system , however , selection must occur over distributed server sets deployed by the participating providers , without the benefit of the full information available in the single-provider case . Intelligent server set selection algorithms will require a model of the expected performance clients would receive from a candidate server set . In this paper , we study whether the complex policies and dynamics of intelligent server selection can be effectively modeled in order to predict client performance for server sets . We introduce a novel server set distance metric , and use it in a measurement study of several million server selection transactions to develop simple models of existing server selection schemes . We then evaluate these models in terms of their ability to accurately predict performance for a second , larger set of distributed clients . We show that our models are able to predict performance within 20ms for over 90 % of the observed samples .

Measuring the causal effects of online advertising ( adfx ) on user behavior is important to the health of the WWW publishing industry .

The reason , which we label `` activity bias , '' comes from the surprising amount of time-based correlation between the myriad activities that users undertake online . In Experiment 1 , users who are exposed to an ad on a given day are much more likely to engage in brand-relevant search queries as compared to their recent history for reasons that had nothing do with the advertisement . In Experiment 2 , we show that activity bias occurs for page views across diverse websites . In Experiment 3 , we track account sign-ups at a competitor 's ( of the advertiser ) website and find that many more people sign-up on the day they saw an advertisement than on other days , but that the true `` competitive effect '' was minimal . In all three experiments , exposure to a campaign signals doing `` more of everything '' in given period of time , making it difficult to find a suitable `` matched control '' using prior behavior . In such cases , the `` match '' is fundamentally different from the exposed group , and we show how and why observational methods lead to a massive overestimate of adfx in such circumstances .", "941642": "CaTTS : calendar types and constraints for Web applications .

The phenomenon of sponsored search advertising is gaining ground as the largest source of revenues for search engines .

But how different are firm 's actual bids from their optimal bids ? Moreover , what are other ways in which firms can potentially benefit from sponsored search advertising ? Based on the model and estimates from prior work ( 10 ) , we conduct a number of policy simulations in order to investigate to what extent an advertiser can benefit from bidding optimally for its keywords .

Our analysis suggests that advertisers are not bidding optimally with respect to maximizing profits . We conduct a detailed analysis with product level variables to explore the extent of cross-selling opportunities across different categories from a given keyword advertisement . We find that there exists significant potential for cross-selling through search keyword advertisements in that consumers often end up buying products from other categories in addition to the product they were searching for .

We show that SPARQL query rewriting combines the most challenging aspects of rewriting for the relational and XML cases : like the relational case , SPARQL query rewriting requires synthesizing multiple views ; like the XML case , the size of the rewritten query is exponential to the size of the query and the views . In this paper , we present the first native query rewriting algorithm for SPARQL . For an input SPARQL query over a set of virtual SPARQL views , the rewritten query resembles a union of conjunctive queries and can be of exponential size . We propose optimizations over the basic rewriting algorithm to ( i ) minimize each conjunctive query in the union ; ( ii ) eliminate conjunctive queries with empty results from evaluation ; and ( iii ) efficiently prune out big portions of the search space of empty rewritings .

The ideas in a fuzzy description logic ( DL ) IR model and a formal DL query method are employed and combined in our model . Based on the model , a semantic search service is implemented and evaluated . The evaluation shows very large improvements over existing methods .", "9398460": "Behavioral classification on the click graph .

Previous work shows that a web page can be partitioned into multiple segments or blocks , and often the importance of those blocks in a page is not equivalent . Also , it has been proven that differentiating noisy or unimportant blocks from pages can facilitate web mining , search and accessibility . However , no uniform approach and model has been presented to measure the importance of different segments in web pages . Through a user study , we found that people do have a consistent view about the importance of blocks in web pages . In this paper , we investigate how to find a model to automatically assign importance values to blocks in a web page . We define the block importance estimation as a learning problem . First , we use a vision-based page segmentation algorithm to partition a web page into semantic blocks with a hierarchical structure . Then spatial features ( such as position and size ) and content features ( such as the number of images and links ) are extracted to construct a feature vector for each block . Based on these features , learning algorithms are used to train a model to assign importance to different segments in the web page . In our experiments , the best model can achieve the performance with Micro-F1 79 % and Micro-Accuracy 85.9 % , which is quite close to a person 's view .", "4859597": "Rapid prototyping of web applications combining domain specific languages and model driven design .

Results show that the text in citing documents , when available , often has greater discriminative and descriptive power than the text in the target document itself . The combination of evidence from a document and citing documents can improve on either information source alone . Moreover , by ranking words and phrases in the citing documents according to expected entropy loss , we are able to accurately name clusters of web pages , even with very few positive examples .

In this paper we show how to define statistical models of different complexity to describe patterns of song listening in an online music community . First , we adapt the LDA model to capture music taste from listening activities across users and identify both the groups of songs associated with the specific taste and the groups of listeners who share the same taste . Second , we define a graphical model that takes into account listening sessions and captures the listening moods of users in the community . Our session model leads to groups of songs and groups of listeners with similar behavior across listening sessions and enables faster inference when compared to the LDA model . Our experiments with the data from an online media site demonstrate that the session model is better in terms of the perplexity compared to two other models : the LDA-based taste model that does not incorporate cross-session information and a baseline model that does not use latent groupings of songs .", "13515810": "Retaining personal expression for social search . Web is being extensively used for personal expression , which includes ratings , reviews , recommendations , blogs . This user created content , e.g. book review on Amazon.com , becomes the property of the website , and the user often does not have easy access to it . In some cases , user 's feedback may get averaged with feedback from other users e.g. ratings of a video . We argue that the creator of such content needs to be able to retain ( a link to ) her created content . We introduce the concept of MEB which is a user controlled store of such retained links . A MEB allows a user to access\\/share all the reviews she has given on different websites . With this capability users can allow their friends to search through their feedback . Searching through one 's social network allows harnessing the power of social networks where known relationships provide the context & trust necessary to interpret feedback .", "13502912": "How much can behavioral targeting help online advertising ? . Behavioral Targeting ( BT ) is a technique used by online advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns , and is playing an increasingly important role in the online advertising market . However , it is underexplored in academia when looking at how much BT can truly help online advertising in commercial search engines . To answer this question , in this paper we provide an empirical study on the click-through log of advertisements collected from a commercial search engine . From the comprehensively experiment results on the sponsored search log of the commercial search engine over a period of seven days , we can draw three important conclusions : ( 1 ) Users who clicked the same ad will truly have similar behaviors on the Web ; ( 2 ) Click-Through Rate ( CTR ) of an ad can be averagely improved as high as 670 % by properly segmenting users for behavioral targeted advertising in a sponsored search ; ( 3 ) Using the short term user behaviors to represent users is more effective than using the long term user behaviors for BT . The statistical t-test verifies that all conclusions drawn in the paper are statistically significant .

Online social networking technologies enable individuals to simultaneously share information with any number of peers . Quantifying the causal effect of these mediums on the dissemination of information requires not only identification of who influences whom , but also of whether individuals would still propagate information in the absence of social signals about that information . We examine the role of social networks in online information diffusion with a large-scale field experiment that randomizes exposure to signals about friends ' information sharing among 253 million subjects in situ . Those who are exposed are significantly more likely to spread information , and do so sooner than those who are not exposed . We further examine the relative role of strong and weak ties in information propagation . We show that , although stronger ties are individually more influential , it is the more abundant weak ties who are responsible for the propagation of novel information . This suggests that weak ties may play a more dominant role in the dissemination of information online than currently believed .", "3677893": "Site level noise removal for search engines . The currently booming search engine industry has determined many online organizations to attempt to artificially increase their ranking in order to attract more visitors to their web sites .

In this work , we study the notion of competing campaigns in a social network and address the problem of influence limitation where a `` bad '' campaign starts propagating from a certain node in the network and use the notion of limiting campaigns to counteract the effect of misinformation . The problem can be summarized as identifying a subset of individuals that need to be convinced to adopt the competing ( or `` good '' ) campaign so as to minimize the number of people that adopt the `` bad '' campaign at the end of both propagation processes . We show that this optimization problem is NP-hard and provide approximation guarantees for a greedy solution for various definitions of this problem by proving that they are submodular . We experimentally compare the performance of the greedy method to various heuristics . The experiments reveal that in most cases inexpensive heuristics such as degree centrality compare well with the greedy approach . We also study the influence limitation problem in the presence of missing data where the current states of nodes in the network are only known with a certain probability and show that prediction in this setting is a supermodular problem . We propose a prediction algorithm that is based on generating random spanning trees and evaluate the performance of this approach . The experiments reveal that using the prediction algorithm , we are able to tolerate about 90 % missing data before the performance of the algorithm starts degrading and even with large amounts of missing data the performance degrades only to 75 % of the performance that would be achieved with complete data .", "3603445": "An experimental study on large-scale web categorization .

Learning to rank is a new statistical learning technology on creating a ranking model for sorting objects . The technology has been successfully applied to web search , and is becoming one of the key machineries for building search engines . Existing approaches to learning to rank , however , did not consider the cases in which there exists relationship between the objects to be ranked , despite of the fact that such situations are very common in practice . For example , in web search , given a query certain relationships usually exist among the the retrieved documents , e.g. , URL hierarchy , similarity , etc. , and sometimes it is necessary to utilize the information in ranking of the documents . This paper addresses the issue and formulates it as a novel learning problem , referred to as , ` learning to rank relational objects ' . In the new learning task , the ranking model is defined as a function of not only the contents ( features ) of objects but also the relations between objects . The paper further focuses on one setting of the learning problem in which the way of using relation information is predetermined . It formalizes the learning task as an optimization problem in the setting . The paper then proposes a new method to perform the optimization task , particularly an implementation based on SVM . Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods for two ranking tasks ( Pseudo Relevance Feedback and Topic Distillation ) in web search , indicating that the proposed method can indeed make effective use of relation information and content information in ranking .", "412745": "Probabilistic query expansion using query logs .

Ontologies play a prominent role on the Semantic Web . They make possible the widespread publication of machine understandable data , opening myriad opportunities for automated information processing . However , because of the Semantic Web 's distributed nature , data on it will inevitably come from many different ontologies . Information processing across ontologies is not possible without knowing the semantic mappings between their elements . Manually finding such mappings is tedious , error-prone , and clearly not possible at the Web scale . Hence , the development of tools to assist in the ontology mapping process is crucial to the success of the Semantic Web . We describe glue , a system that employs machine learning techniques to find such mappings . Given two ontologies , for each concept in one ontology glue finds the most similar concept in the other ontology . We give well-founded probabilistic definitions to several practical similarity measures , and show that glue can work with all of them . This is in contrast to most existing approaches , which deal with a single similarity measure . Another key feature of glue is that it uses multiple learning strategies , each of which exploits a different type of information either in the data instances or in the taxonomic structure of the ontologies . To further improve matching accuracy , we extend glue to incorporate commonsense knowledge and domain constraints into the matching process . For this purpose , we show that relaxation labeling , a well-known constraint optimization technique used in computer vision and other fields , can be adapted to work efficiently in our context . Our approach is thus distinguished in that it works with a variety of well-defined similarity notions and that it efficiently incorporates multiple types of knowledge .

Auctions are widely used on the Web . Applications range from internet advertising to platforms such as eBay .

The main drawback of standard mechanisms for this type of auctions , such as VCG and GSP , is the limited expressiveness that they offer to the bidders . The General Auction Mechanism ( GAM ) of ( 1 ) is taking a first step towards addressing the problem of limited expressiveness by computing a bidder optimal , envy free outcome for linear utility functions with identical slopes and a single discontinuity per bidder-item pair . We show that in many practical situations this does not suffice to adequately model the preferences of the bidders , and we overcome this problem by presenting the first mechanism for piece-wise linear utility functions with non-identical slopes and multiple discontinuities . Our mechanism runs in polynomial time . Like GAM it is incentive compatible for inputs that fulfill a certain non-degeneracy requirement , but our requirement is more general than the requirement of GAM . For discontinuous utility functions that are non-degenerate as well as for continuous utility functions the outcome of our mechanism is a competitive equilibrium .

The resulting routing indices can be built using dynamic frequency counting algorithms and support local mediation and transformation rules , and we will sketch some first ideas for implementing these advanced functionalities as well .", "10274995": "Towards context-aware search by learning a very large variable length hidden markov model from search logs . Capturing the context of a user 's query from the previous queries and clicks in the same session may help understand the user 's information need . A context-aware approach to document re-ranking , query suggestion , and URL recommendation may improve users ' search experience substantially . In this paper , we propose a general approach to context-aware search . To capture contexts of queries , we learn a variable length Hidden Markov Model ( vlHMM ) from search sessions extracted from log data . Although the mathematical model is intuitive , how to learn a large vlHMM with millions of states from hundreds of millions of search sessions poses a grand challenge . We develop a strategy for parameter initialization in vlHMM learning which can greatly reduce the number of parameters to be estimated in practice . We also devise a method for distributed vlHMM learning under the map-reduce model . We test our approach on a real data set consisting of 1.8 billion queries , 2.6 billion clicks , and 840 million search sessions , and evaluate the effectiveness of the vlHMM learned from the real data on three search applications : document re-ranking , query suggestion , and URL recommendation .

Navigating information spaces is an essential part of our everyday lives , and in order to design efficient and user-friendly information systems , it is important to understand how humans navigate and find the information they are looking for . We perform a large-scale study of human wayfinding , in which , given a network of links between the concepts of Wikipedia , people play a game of finding a short path from a given start to a given target concept by following hyperlinks . What distinguishes our setup from other studies of human Web-browsing behavior is that in our case people navigate a graph of connections between concepts , and that the exact goal of the navigation is known ahead of time . We study more than 30,000 goal-directed human search paths and identify strategies people use when navigating information spaces . We find that human wayfinding , while mostly very efficient , differs from shortest paths in characteristic ways . Most subjects navigate through high-degree hubs in the early phase , while their search is guided by content features thereafter . We also observe a trade-off between simplicity and efficiency : conceptually simple solutions are more common but tend to be less efficient than more complex ones . Finally , we consider the task of predicting the target a user is trying to reach . We design a model and an efficient learning algorithm . Such predictive models of human wayfinding can be applied in intelligent browsing interfaces .", "9647936": "StatSnowball : a statistical approach to extracting entity relationships . Traditional relation extraction methods require pre-specified relations and relation-specific human-tagged examples . Bootstrapping systems significantly reduce the number of training examples , but they usually apply heuristic-based methods to combine a set of strict hard rules , which limit the ability to generalize and thus generate a low recall . Furthermore , existing bootstrapping methods do not perform open information extraction ( Open IE ) , which can identify various types of relations without requiring pre-specifications . In this paper , we propose a statistical extraction framework called Statistical Snowball ( StatSnowball ) , which is a bootstrapping system and can perform both traditional relation extraction and Open IE . StatSnowball uses the discriminative Markov logic networks ( MLNs ) and softens hard rules by learning their weights in a maximum likelihood estimate sense . MLN is a general model , and can be configured to perform different levels of relation extraction . In StatSnwoball , pattern selection is performed by solving an l1-norm penalized maximum likelihood estimation , which enjoys well-founded theories and efficient solvers . We extensively evaluate the performance of StatSnowball in different configurations on both a small but fully labeled data set and large-scale Web data . Empirical results show that StatSnowball can achieve a significantly higher recall without sacrificing the high precision during iterations with a small number of seeds , and the joint inference of MLN can improve the performance . Finally , StatSnowball is efficient and we have developed a working entity relation search engine called Renlifang based on it .", "8929692": "Distributed location aware web crawling .

The popularity of social media websites like Flickr and Twitter has created enormous collections of user-generated content online . Latent in these content collections are observations of the world : each photo is a visual snapshot of what the world looked like at a particular point in time and space , for example , while each tweet is a textual expression of the state of a person and his or her environment . Aggregating these observations across millions of social sharing users could lead to new techniques for large-scale monitoring of the state of the world and how it is changing over time . In this paper we step towards that goal , showing that by analyzing the tags and image features of geo-tagged , time-stamped photos we can measure and quantify the occurrence of ecological phenomena including ground snow cover , snow fall and vegetation density . We compare several techniques for dealing with the large degree of noise in the dataset , and show how machine learning can be used to reduce errors caused by misleading tags and ambiguous visual content .

Most models for online advertising assume that an advertiser 's value from winning an ad auction , which depends on the clickthrough rate or conversion rate of the advertisement , is independent of other advertisements served alongside it in the same session . This ignores an important ` externality effect ' : as the advertising audience has a limited attention span , a high-quality ad on a page can detract attention from other ads on the same page . That is , the utility to a winner in such an auction also depends on the set of other winners . In this paper , we introduce the problem of modeling externalities in online advertising , and study the winner determination problem in these models . Our models are based on choice models on the audience side . We show that in the most general case , the winner determination problem is hard even to approximate . However , we give an approximation algorithm for this problem with an approximation factor that is logarithmic in the ratio of the maximum to the minimum bid . Furthermore , we show that there are some interesting special cases , such as the case where the audience preferences are single peaked , where the problem can be solved exactly in polynomial time . For all these algorithms , we prove that the winner determination algorithm can be combined with VCG-style payments to yield truthful mechanisms .", "1848435": "Structuring and presenting annotated media repositories .

Social ties are crucial in understanding the network the people are a part of . However , textual content is extremely useful in understanding topics discussed and the personality of the individual .

Nearness is defined as a flexible , trainable parameterized aggregation function of the selectors , their frequency in the corpus , and their distance from the candidate answer .

We present a scalable distributed RDF repository ( RDFPeers ) that stores each triple at three places in a multi-attribute addressable network by applying globally known hash functions to its subject predicate and object . Thus all nodes know which node is responsible for storing triple values they are looking for and both exact-match and range queries can be efficiently routed to those nodes . RDFPeers has no single point of failure nor elevated peers and does not require the prior definition of RDF schemas .

The objective is to allocate a fixed budget among the source nodes to maximize the expected number of influenced target nodes . The concrete way in which source nodes influence target nodes depends on the underlying model . We primarily consider two models : a source-side influence model , in which a source node that is allocated a budget of k makes k independent trials to influence each of its neighboring target nodes , and a target-side influence model , in which a target node becomes influenced according to a specified rule that depends on the overall budget allocated to its neighbors .

Transaction times are associated with each file version to record the version 's lifetime . The transaction time is the system time of the edit that created the version . Accounting for transaction time is essential to supporting audit queries that delve into past document versions and differential queries that pinpoint differences between two versions .

Since some versions may be created but never read , TTApache distinguishes between known and assumed versions of a document . TTApache has a simple query language to retrieve desired versions . A browser can request a specific version , or the entire history of a document . Queries can also rewrite links and references to point to current or past versions .

In this paper , we address the problem of forecasting the number of impressions for new or changed ads in the system . Producing such forecasts , even within large margins of error , is quite challenging : 1 ) ad selection in contextual advertising is a complicated process based on tens or even hundreds of page and ad features ; 2 ) the publishers ' content and traffic vary over time ; and 3 ) the scale of the problem is daunting : over a course of a week it involves billions of impressions , hundreds of millions of distinct pages , hundreds of millions of ads , and varying bids of other competing advertisers . We tackle these complexities by simulating the presence of a given ad with its associated bid over weeks of historical data . We obtain an impression estimate by counting how many times the ad would have been displayed if it were in the system over that period of time . We estimate this count by an efficient two-level search algorithm over the distinct pages in the data set . Experimental results show that our approach can accurately forecast the expected number of impressions of contextual ads in real time . We also show how this method can be used in tools for bid selection and ad evaluation .", "69764": "On the bursty evolution of blogspace . We propose two new tools to address the evolution of hyperlinked corpora . First , we define time graphs to extend the traditional notion of an evolving directed graph , capturing link creation as a point phenomenon in time . Second , we develop definitions and algorithms for time-dense community tracking , to crystallize the notion of community evolution . We develop these tools in the context of Blogspace , the space of weblogs ( or blogs ) . Our study involves approximately 750K links among 25K blogs . We create a time graph on these blogs by an automatic analysis of their internal time stamps . We then study the evolution of connected component structure and microscopic community structure in this time graph . We show that Blogspace underwent a transition behavior around the end of 2001 , and has been rapidly expanding over the past year , not just in metrics of scale , but also in metrics of community structure and connectedness . This expansion shows no sign of abating , although measures of connectedness must plateau within two years . By randomizing link destinations in Blogspace , but retaining sources and timestamps , we introduce a concept of randomized Blogspace . Herein , we observe similar evolution of a giant component , but no corresponding increase in community structure . Having demonstrated the formation of micro-communities over time , we then turn to the ongoing activity within active communities .

Typical approaches for querying structured Web Data collect ( crawl ) and pre-process ( index ) large amounts of data in a central data repository before allowing for query answering . However , this time-consuming pre-processing phase however leverages the benefits of Linked Data -- where structured data is accessible live and up-to-date at distributed Web resources that may change constantly -- only to a limited degree , as query results can never be current . An ideal query answering system for Linked Data should return current answers in a reasonable amount of time , even on corpora as large as the Web . Query processors evaluating queries directly on the live sources require knowledge of the contents of data sources . In this paper , we develop and evaluate an approximate index structure summarising graph-structured content of sources adhering to Linked Data principles , provide an algorithm for answering conjunctive queries over Linked Data on theWeb exploiting the source summary , and evaluate the system using synthetically generated queries . The experimental results show that our lightweight index structure enables complete and up-to-date query results over Linked Data , while keeping the overhead for querying low and providing a satisfying source ranking at no additional cost .", "9940239": "A contextual-bandit approach to personalized news article recommendation . Personalized web services strive to adapt their services ( advertisements , news articles , etc. ) to individual users by making use of both content and user information . Despite a few recent advances , this problem remains challenging for at least two reasons . First , web service is featured with dynamically changing pools of content , rendering traditional collaborative filtering methods inapplicable . Second , the scale of most web services of practical interest calls for solutions that are both fast in learning and computation . In this work , we model personalized recommendation of news articles as a contextual bandit problem , a principled approach in which a learning algorithm sequentially selects articles to serve users based on contextual information about the users and articles , while simultaneously adapting its article-selection strategy based on user-click feedback to maximize total user clicks . The contributions of this work are three-fold . First , we propose a new , general contextual bandit algorithm that is computationally efficient and well motivated from learning theory . Second , we argue that any bandit algorithm can be reliably evaluated offline using previously recorded random traffic . Finally , using this offline evaluation method , we successfully applied our new algorithm to a Yahoo ! Front Page Today Module dataset containing over 33 million events . Results showed a 12.5 % click lift compared to a standard context-free bandit algorithm , and the advantage becomes even greater when data gets more scarce .", "14389220": "Strategic formation of credit networks . Credit networks are an abstraction for modeling trust between agents in a network . Agents who do not directly trust each other can transact through exchange of IOUs ( obligations ) along a chain of trust in the network . Credit networks are robust to intrusion , can enable transactions between strangers in exchange economies , and have the liquidity to support a high rate of transactions . We study the formation of such networks when agents strategically decide how much credit to extend each other . When each agent trusts a fixed set of other agents , and transacts directly only with those it trusts , the formation game is a potential game and all Nash equilibria are social optima . Moreover , the Nash equilibria of this game are equivalent in a very strong sense : the sequences of transactions that can be supported from each equilibrium credit network are identical . When we allow transactions over longer paths , the game may not admit a Nash equilibrium , and even when it does , the price of anarchy may be unbounded . Hence , we study two special cases . First , when agents have a shared belief about the trustworthiness of each agent , the networks formed in equilibrium have a star-like structure . Though the price of anarchy is unbounded , myopic best response quickly converges to a social optimum . Similar star-like structures are found in equilibria of heuristic strategies found via simulation . In addition , we simulate a second case where agents may have varying information about each others ' trustworthiness based on their distance in a social network . Empirical game analysis of these scenarios suggests that star structures arise only when defaults are relatively rare , and otherwise , credit tends to be issued over short social distances conforming to the locality of information .", "6094737": "Mining the search trails of surfing crowds : identifying relevant websites from user activity . The paper proposes identifying relevant information sources from the history of combined searching and browsing behavior of many Web users .

The paper demonstrates that users ' post-search browsing activity strongly reflects implicit endorsement of visited pages , which allows estimating topical relevance of Web resources by mining large-scale datasets of search trails . We present heuristic and probabilistic algorithms that rely on such datasets for suggesting authoritative websites for search queries .

Automatic folksonomy construction from tags has attracted much attention recently .

We explore two statistical frameworks for aggregating many shallow individual hierarchies , expressed through the collection\\/set relations on the social photosharing site Flickr , into a common deeper folksonomy that reflects how a community organizes knowledge . Our approach addresses a number of challenges that arise while aggregating information from diverse users , namely noisy vocabulary , and variations in the granularity level of the concepts expressed .

Out-of-context methods select salient regions from the landing page by analyzing the content alone , without taking into account the ad associated with the landing page . In-context methods use the ad context ( including its title , creative , and bid phrases ) to help identify regions of the landing page that should be used by the ad selection engine . In addition , we introduce a simple yet effective unsupervised algorithm to enrich the ad context to further improve the ad selection . Experimental evaluation confirms that the use of landing pages can significantly improve the quality of ad selection .

Peer-to-peer information sharing environments are increasingly gaining acceptance on the Internet as they provide an infrastructure in which the desired information can be located and downloaded while preserving the anonymity of both requestors and providers .

In this paper we propose an approach to P2P security where servents can keep track , and share with others , information about the reputation of their peers . Reputation sharing is based on a distributed polling algorithm by which resource requestors can assess the reliability of perspective providers before initiating the download . The approach nicely complements the existing P2P protocols and has a limited impact on current implementations .

Search auctions have become a dominant source of revenue generation on the Internet . Such auctions have typically used per-click bidding and pricing . We propose the use of hybrid auctions where an advertiser can make a per-impression as well as a per-click bid , and the auctioneer then chooses one of the two as the pricing mechanism . We assume that the advertiser and the auctioneer both have separate beliefs ( called priors ) on the click-probability of an advertisement . We first prove that the hybrid auction is truthful , assuming that the advertisers are risk-neutral . We then show that this auction is superior to the existing per-click auction in multiple ways : We show that risk-seeking advertisers will choose only a per-impression bid whereas risk-averse advertisers will choose only a per-click bid , and argue that both kind of advertisers arise naturally . Hence , the ability to bid in a hybrid fashion is important to account for the risk characteristics of the advertisers . For obscure keywords , the auctioneer is unlikely to have a very sharp prior on the click-probabilities . In such situations , we show that having the extra information from the advertisers in the form of a per-impression bid can result in significantly higher revenue . An advertiser who believes that its click-probability is much higher than the auctioneer 's estimate can use per-impression bids to correct the auctioneer 's prior without incurring any extra cost . The hybrid auction can allow the advertiser and auctioneer to implement complex dynamic programming strategies to deal with the uncertainty in the click-probability using the same basic auction . The per-click and per-impression bidding schemes can only be used to implement two extreme cases of these strategies . As Internet commerce matures , we need more sophisticated pricing models to exploit all the information held by each of the participants . We believe that hybrid auctions could be an important step in this direction . The hybrid auction easily extends to multiple slots , and is also applicable to scenarios where the hybrid bidding is per-impression and per-action ( i.e. CPM and CPA ) , or per-click and per-action ( i.e. CPC and CPA ) .", "4402089": "Mobile web publishing and surfing based on environmental sensing data .", "3935403": "Personalizing E-commerce applications with on-line heuristic decision making .", "4509995": "Ontalk : ontology-based personal document management system .

This paper proposes an algorithm to hierarchically cluster documents . Each cluster is actually a cluster of documents and an associated cluster of words , thus a document-word co-cluster .

One would intuitively expect a submatrix made up of high values to be a good document cluster , with the corresponding word cluster containing its most distinctive features . Our algorithm looks to exploit this . We have defined matrix density , and our algorithm basically uses matrix density considerations in its working . The algorithm is a partitional-agglomerative algorithm . The partitioning step involves the identification of dense submatrices so that the respective row sets partition the row set of the complete matrix . The hierarchical agglomerative step involves merging the most `` similar '' submatrices until we are down to the required number of clusters ( if we want a flat clustering ) or until we have just the single complete matrix left ( if we are interested in a hierarchical arrangement of documents ) . It also generates apt labels for each cluster or hierarchy node . The similarity measure between clusters that we use here for the merging cleverly uses the fact that the clusters here are co-clusters , and is a key point of difference from existing agglomerative algorithms . We will refer to the proposed algorithm as RPSA ( Rowset Partitioning and Submatrix Agglomeration ) .

Most of the online advertising today is sold via an auction , which requires the advertiser to respond with a valid bid within a fraction of a second .

The online strategy is typically highly dependent on both supply and expected price distributions , both of which are forecast using traditional machine learning methods . In this work we investigate the optimum strategy of the bidding agent when faced with incorrect forecasts . At a high level , the agent can invest resources in improving the forecasts , or can tighten the loop between successive offline optimization cycles in order to detect errors more quickly .

We develop a set of natural axioms that a diversification system is expected to satisfy , and show that no diversification function can satisfy all the axioms simultaneously . We illustrate the use of the axiomatic framework by providing three example diversification objectives that satisfy different subsets of the axioms .

To tackle this problem , we propose and study a generative model for input queries , based on a noisy channel transformation of the intended queries .

Measuring the similarity between semantic relations that hold among entities is an important and necessary step in various Web related tasks such as relation extraction , information retrieval and analogy detection . For example , consider the case in which a person knows a pair of entities ( e.g. Google , YouTube ) , between which a particular relation holds ( e.g. acquisition ) . The person is interested in retrieving other such pairs with similar relations ( e.g. Microsoft , Powerset ) . Existing keyword-based search engines can not be applied directly in this case because , in keyword-based search , the goal is to retrieve documents that are relevant to the words used in a query -- not necessarily to the relations implied by a pair of words . We propose a relational similarity measure , using a Web search engine , to compute the similarity between semantic relations implied by two pairs of words . Our method has three components : representing the various semantic relations that exist between a pair of words using automatically extracted lexical patterns , clustering the extracted lexical patterns to identify the different patterns that express a particular semantic relation , and measuring the similarity between semantic relations using a metric learning approach . We evaluate the proposed method in two tasks : classifying semantic relations between named entities , and solving word-analogy questions . The proposed method outperforms all baselines in a relation classification task with a statistically significant average precision score of 0.74 .

Understanding social interaction within groups is key to analyzing online communities . Most current work focuses on structural properties : who talks to whom , and how such interactions form larger network structures .

To date , however , finding domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge . Here , we show that in group discussions , power differentials between participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes the linguistic style of the person they are responding to . Starting from this observation , we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power -- including a more `` static '' form of power based on status differences , and a more `` situational '' form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another .

Search engines are the primary gateways of information access on the Web today . Behind the scenes , search engines crawl the Web to populate a local indexed repository of Web pages , used to answer user search queries . In an aggregate sense , the Web is very dynamic , causing any repository of Web pages to become out of date over time , which in turn causes query answer quality to degrade . Given the considerable size , dynamicity , and degree of autonomy of the Web as a whole , it is not feasible for a search engine to maintain its repository exactly synchronized with the Web . In this paper we study how to schedule Web pages for selective ( re ) downloading into a search engine repository . The scheduling objective is to maximize the quality of the user experience for those who query the search engine . We begin with a quantitative characterization of the way in which the discrepancy between the content of the repository and the current content of the live Web impacts the quality of the user experience . This characterization leads to a user-centric metric of the quality of a search engine 's local repository . We use this metric to derive a policy for scheduling Web page ( re ) downloading that is driven by search engine usage and free of exterior tuning parameters . We then focus on the important subproblem of scheduling refreshing of Web pages already present in the repository , and show how to compute the priorities efficiently .

Modeling a user 's click-through behavior in click logs is a challenging task due to the well-known position bias problem .

Specifically , users with different search intents may submit the same query to the search engine but expect different search results . Thus , there might be a bias between user search intent and the query formulated by the user , which can lead to the diversity in user clicks . This bias has not been considered in previous works such as UBM , DBN and CCM . In this paper , we propose a new intent hypothesis as a complement to the examination hypothesis . This hypothesis is used to characterize the bias between the user search intent and the query in each search session .

Extracting semantic relations among entities is an important first step in various tasks in Web mining and natural language processing such as information extraction , relation detection , and social network mining . A relation can be expressed extensionally by stating all the instances of that relation or intensionally by defining all the paraphrases of that relation . For example , consider the ACQUISITION relation between two companies . An extensional definition of ACQUISITION contains all pairs of companies in which one company is acquired by another ( e.g. ( YouTube , Google ) or ( Powerset , Microsoft ) ) . On the other hand we can intensionally define ACQUISITION as the relation described by lexical patterns such as X is acquired by Y , or Y purchased X , where X and Y denote two companies . We use this dual representation of semantic relations to propose a novel sequential co-clustering algorithm that can extract numerous relations efficiently from unlabeled data . We provide an efficient heuristic to find the parameters of the proposed coclustering algorithm . Using the clusters produced by the algorithm , we train an L1 regularized logistic regression model to identify the representative patterns that describe the relation expressed by each cluster .

Relational autocorrelation is ubiquitous in relational domains . This observed correlation between class labels of linked instances in a network ( e.g. , two friends are more likely to share political beliefs than two randomly selected people ) can be due to the effects of two different social processes . If social influence effects are present , instances are likely to change their attributes to conform to their neighbor values . If homophily effects are present , instances are likely to link to other individuals with similar attribute values . Both these effects will result in autocorrelated attribute values . When analyzing static relational networks it is impossible to determine how much of the observed correlation is due each of these factors . However , the recent surge of interest in social networks has increased the availability of dynamic network data . In this paper , we present a randomization technique for temporal network data where the attributes and links change over time . Given data from two time steps , we measure the gain in correlation and assess whether a significant portion of this gain is due to influence and\\/or homophily . We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on semi-synthetic data and then apply the method to a real-world social networks dataset , showing the impact of both influence and homophily effects .", "10525233": "PAKE-based mutual HTTP authentication for preventing phishing attacks .

Time-based , media-centric Web presentations can be described declaratively in the XML world through the development of languages such as SMIL . It is difficult , however , to fully integrate them in a complete document transformation processing chain .

Multimedia scheduling models provide a rich variety of tools for managing the synchronization of media like video and audio , but generally have an inflexible model for time itself .

Multimedia authors have been forced to choose one set of features over the others , limiting the range of presentations they can create . Some programming models addressed some of these problems , but provided no declarative means for authors and authoring tools to leverage the functionality .

The Semantic Web envisions a World Wide Web in which data is described with rich semantics and applications can pose complex queries . To this point , researchers have defined new languages for specifying meanings for concepts and developed techniques for reasoning about them , using RDF as the data model . To flourish , the Semantic Web needs to be able to accommodate the huge amounts of existing data and the applications operating on them . To achieve this , we are faced with two problems . First , most of the world 's data is available not in RDF but in XML ; XML and the applications consuming it rely not only on the domain structure of the data , but also on its document structure . Hence , to provide interoperability between such sources , we must map between both their domain structures and their document structures . Second , data management practitioners often prefer to exchange data through local point-to-point data translations , rather than mapping to common mediated schemas or ontologies . This paper describes the Piazza system , which addresses these challenges . Piazza offers a language for mediating between data sources on the Semantic Web , which maps both the domain structure and document structure . Piazza also enables interoperation of XML data with RDF data that is accompanied by rich OWL ontologies . Mappings in Piazza are provided at a local scale between small sets of nodes , and our query answering algorithm is able to chain sets mappings together to obtain relevant data from across the Piazza network .

The success and popularity of social network systems , such as del. icio . us , Facebook , MySpace , and YouTube , have generated many interesting and challenging problems to the research community . Among others , discovering social interests shared by groups of users is very important because it helps to connect people with common interests and encourages people to contribute and share more contents . The main challenge to solving this problem comes from the difficulty of detecting and representing the interest of the users . The existing approaches are all based on the online connections of users and so unable to identify the common interest of users who have no online connections . In this paper , we propose a novel social interest discovery approach based on user-generated tags . Our approach is motivated by the key observation that in a social network , human users tend to use descriptive tags to annotate the contents that they are interested in . Our analysis on a large amount of real-world traces reveals that in general , user-generated tags are consistent with the web content they are attached to , while more concise and closer to the understanding and judgments of human users about the content . Thus , patterns of frequent co-occurrences of user tags can be used to characterize and capture topics of user interests . We have developed an Internet Social Interest Discovery system , ISID , to discover the common user interests and cluster users and their saved URLs by different interest topics . Our evaluation shows that ISID can effectively cluster similar documents by interest topics and discover user communities with common interests no matter if they have any online connections .", "13788838": "Spotting fake reviewer groups in consumer reviews . Opinionated social media such as product reviews are now widely used by individuals and organizations for their decision making . However , due to the reason of profit or fame , people try to game the system by opinion spamming ( e.g. , writing fake reviews ) to promote or demote some target products . For reviews to reflect genuine user experiences and opinions , such spam reviews should be detected . Prior works on opinion spam focused on detecting fake reviews and individual fake reviewers . However , a fake reviewer group ( a group of reviewers who work collaboratively to write fake reviews ) is even more damaging as they can take total control of the sentiment on the target product due to its size . This paper studies spam detection in the collaborative setting , i.e. , to discover fake reviewer groups . The proposed method first uses a frequent itemset mining method to find a set of candidate groups . It then uses several behavioral models derived from the collusion phenomenon among fake reviewers and relation models based on the relationships among groups , individual reviewers , and products they reviewed to detect fake reviewer groups . Additionally , we also built a labeled dataset of fake reviewer groups . Although labeling individual fake reviews and reviewers is very hard , to our surprise labeling fake reviewer groups is much easier . We also note that the proposed technique departs from the traditional supervised learning approach for spam detection because of the inherent nature of our problem which makes the classic supervised learning approach less effective . Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms multiple strong baselines including the state-of-the-art supervised classification , regression , and learning to rank algorithms .", "388759": "A search engine for natural language applications . Many modern natural language-processing applications utilize search engines to locate large numbers of Web documents or to compute statistics over the Web corpus . Yet Web search engines are designed and optimized for simple human queries -- they are not well suited to support such applications . As a result , these applications are forced to issue millions of successive queries resulting in unnecessary search engine load and in slow applications with limited scalability . In response , this paper introduces the Bindings Engine ( BE ) , which supports queries containing typed variables and string-processing functions . For example , in response to the query `` powerful ` noun ' '' BE will return all the nouns in its index that immediately follow the word `` powerful '' , sorted by frequency . In response to the query `` Cities such as ProperNoun ( Head ( ` NounPhrase ' ) ) '' , BE will return a list of proper nouns likely to be city names . BE 's novel neighborhood index enables it to do so with O ( k ) random disk seeks and O ( k ) serial disk reads , where k is the number of non-variable terms in its query . As a result , BE can yield several orders of magnitude speedup for large-scale language-processing applications . The main cost is a modest increase in space to store the index . We report on experiments validating these claims , and analyze how BE 's space-time tradeoff scales with the size of its index and the number of variable types . Finally , we describe how a BE-based application extracts thousands of facts from the Web at interactive speeds in response to simple user queries .", "8951271": "Automatic generation of link collections and their visualization .

The asymmetry of activity in virtual communities is of great interest . While participation in the activities of virtual communities is crucial for a community 's survival and development , many people prefer lurking , that is passive attention over active participation . Lurking can be measured and perhaps affected by both dispositional and situational variables . This work investigates the concept of cultural capital as situational antecedent of lurking and de-lurking ( the decision to start posting after a certain amount of lurking time ) . Cultural capital is defined as the knowledge that enables an individual to interpret various cultural codes . The main hypothesis states that a user 's cultural capital affects her level of activity in a community and her decision to de-lurk and cease to exist in very active communities because of information overload . This hypothesis is analyzed by mathematically defining a social communication network ( SCN ) of activities in authenticated discussion forums . We validate this model by examining the SCN using data collected in a sample of 636 online forums in Open University in Israel and 2 work based communities from IBM . The hypotheses verified here make it clear that fostering receptive participation may be as important and constructive as encouraging active contributions in online communities .", "10563630": "Earthquake shakes Twitter users : real-time event detection by social sensors . Twitter , a popular microblogging service , has received much attention recently . An important characteristic of Twitter is its real-time nature .

As described in this paper , we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event . To detect a target event , we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet , the number of words , and their context . Subsequently , we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location . We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering , which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous\\/pervasive computing . The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons . As an application , we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan . Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country , we can detect an earthquake with high probability ( 96 % of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected ) merely by monitoring tweets .

SPARQL - the standard query language for querying RDF - provides only limited navigational functionalities , although these features are of fundamental importance for graph data formats such as RDF .

We tested several implementations of SPARQL 1.1 handling property path queries , and we observed that their evaluation methods for this class of queries have a poor performance even in some very simple scenarios . To formally explain this fact , we conduct a theoretical study of the computational complexity of property paths evaluation . Our results imply that the poor performance of the tested implementations is not a problem of these particular systems , but of the specification itself . In fact , we show that any implementation that adheres to the SPARQL 1.1 specification ( as of November 2011 ) is doomed to show the same behavior , the key issue being the need for counting solutions imposed by the current specification .

Document summarization plays an increasingly important role with the exponential growth of documents on the Web . Many supervised and unsupervised approaches have been proposed to generate summaries from documents .

In this paper , we consider extract-based summarization emphasizing the following three requirements : 1 ) diversity in summarization , which seeks to reduce redundancy among sentences in the summary ; 2 ) sufficient coverage , which focuses on avoiding the loss of the document 's main information when generating the summary ; and 3 ) balance , which demands that different aspects of the document need to have about the same relative importance in the summary . We formulate the extract-based summarization problem as learning a mapping from a set of sentences of a given document to a subset of the sentences that satisfies the above three requirements .

Thus , existing XML normal forms guarantee well-designed relational storagesas well . We further show that if this perfect option is not achievable , then a slight restriction on XML constraints guarantees a `` second-best '' relational design , according to possible values of the information-theoretic measure .

The contribution of this paper is twofold : First we provide an abstract model of a market design that enables the trade of derivatives for mission-critical Web services . Our model satisfies requirements that result from service characteristics such as intangibility and the impossibility to inventor services in order to meet fluctuating demand . It comprehends principles from models of incomplete markets such as the absence of a tradeable underlying and consistent arbitrage-free derivative pricing . Furthermore we provide an architecture for a Web service market that implements our model and describes the strategy space and interaction of market participants in the trading process of service derivatives . We compare the underlying pricing processes to existing derivative models in energy exchanges , discuss eventual shortcomings , and apply Wavelets to analyze actual data and extract long - and short-term trends .", "3613976": "Representing personal web information using a topic-oriented interface . Nowadays , Web activities have become daily practice for people . It is therefore essential to organize and present this continuously increasing Web information in a more usable manner . In this paper , we developed a novel approach to reorganize personal Web information as a topic-oriented interface . In our approach , we proposed to utilize anchor , title and URL information to represent content information for the browsed Web pages rather than the content body . Furthermore , we explored three methods to organize personal Web information : 1 ) top-down statistical clustering ; 2 ) salience phrase based clustering ; and 3 ) support vector machine ( SVM ) based classification . Finally , we conducted a usability study to verify the effectiveness of our proposed solution . The experimental results demonstrated that users could visit the pages that have been browsed previously more easily with our approach than existing solutions .", "10946910": "Exploring web scale language models for search query processing . It has been widely observed that search queries are composed in a very different style from that of the body or the title of a document . Many techniques explicitly accounting for this language style discrepancy have shown promising results for information retrieval , yet a large scale analysis on the extent of the language differences has been lacking . In this paper , we present an extensive study on this issue by examining the language model properties of search queries and the three text streams associated with each web document : the body , the title , and the anchor text . Our information theoretical analysis shows that queries seem to be composed in a way most similar to how authors summarize documents in anchor texts or titles , offering a quantitative explanation to the observations in past work . We apply these web scale n-gram language models to three search query processing ( SQP ) tasks : query spelling correction , query bracketing and long query segmentation . By controlling the size and the order of different language models , we find that the perplexity metric to be a good accuracy indicator for these query processing tasks . We show that using smoothed language models yields significant accuracy gains for query bracketing for instance , compared to using web counts as in the literature . We also demonstrate that applying web-scale language models can have marked accuracy advantage over smaller ones .", "4603143": "Selective hypertext induced topic search .

Peer-to-peer file-sharing networks are currently receiving much attention as a means of sharing and distributing information . However , as recent experience shows , the anonymous , open nature of these networks offers an almost ideal environment for the spread of self-replicating inauthentic files . We describe an algorithm to decrease the number of downloads of inauthentic files in a peer-to-peer file-sharing network that assigns each peer a unique global trust value , based on the peer 's history of uploads . We present a distributed and secure method to compute global trust values , based on Power iteration . By having peers use these global trust values to choose the peers from whom they download , the network effectively identifies malicious peers and isolates them from the network . In simulations , this reputation system , called EigenTrust , has been shown to significantly decrease the number of inauthentic files on the network , even under a variety of conditions where malicious peers cooperate in an attempt to deliberately subvert the system .", "14380564": "Structured query suggestion for specialization and parallel movement : effect on search behaviors . Query suggestion , which enables the user to revise a query with a single click , has become one of the most fundamental features of Web search engines . However , it is often difficult for the user to choose from a list of query suggestions , and to understand the relation between an input query and suggested ones . In this paper , we propose a new method to present query suggestions to the user , which has been designed to help two popular query reformulation actions , namely , specialization ( e.g. from `` nikon '' to `` nikon camera '' ) and parallel movement ( e.g. from `` nikon camera '' to `` canon camera '' ) . Using a query log collected from a popular commercial Web search engine , our prototype called SParQS classifies query suggestions into automatically generated categories and generates a label for each category . Moreover , SParQS presents some new entities as alternatives to the original query ( e.g. `` canon '' in response to the query `` nikon '' ) , together with their query suggestions classified in the same way as the original query 's suggestions . We conducted a task-based user study to compare SParQS with a traditional `` flat list '' query suggestion interface . Our results show that the SParQS interface enables subjects to search more successfully than the flat list case , even though query suggestions presented were exactly the same in the two interfaces . In addition , the subjects found the query suggestions more helpful when they were presented in the SParQS interface rather than in a flat list .", "14045611": "Online team formation in social networks .

The goal is to form a new team upon arrival of each task , so that ( i ) each team possesses all skills required by the task , ( ii ) each team has small communication overhead , and ( iii ) the workload of performing the tasks is balanced among people in the fairest possible way . We propose efficient algorithms that address all these requirements : our algorithms form teams that always satisfy the required skills , provide approximation guarantees with respect to team communication overhead , and they are online-competitive with respect to load balancing . Experiments performed on collaboration networks among film actors and scientists , confirm that our algorithms are successful at balancing these conflicting requirements .

There is a widespread intuitive sense that different kinds of information spread differently on-line , but it has been difficult to evaluate this question quantitatively since it requires a setting where many different kinds of information spread in a shared environment . Here we study this issue on Twitter , analyzing the ways in which tokens known as hashtags spread on a network defined by the interactions among Twitter users . We find significant variation in the ways that widely-used hashtags on different topics spread . Our results show that this variation is not attributable simply to differences in `` stickiness , '' the probability of adoption based on one or more exposures , but also to a quantity that could be viewed as a kind of `` persistence '' - the relative extent to which repeated exposures to a hashtag continue to have significant marginal effects . We find that hashtags on politically controversial topics are particularly persistent , with repeated exposures continuing to have unusually large marginal effects on adoption ; this provides , to our knowledge , the first large-scale validation of the `` complex contagion '' principle from sociology , which posits that repeated exposures to an idea are particularly crucial when the idea is in some way controversial or contentious . Among other findings , we discover that hashtags representing the natural analogs of Twitter idioms and neologisms are particularly non-persistent , with the effect of multiple exposures decaying rapidly relative to the first exposure . We also study the subgraph structure of the initial adopters for different widely-adopted hashtags , again finding structural differences across topics . We develop simulation-based and generative models to analyze how the adoption dynamics interact with the network structure of the early adopters on which a hashtag spreads .", "13061989": "Learning to model relatedness for news recommendation . With the explosive growth of online news readership , recommending interesting news articles to users has become extremely important . While existing Web services such as Yahoo ! and Digg attract users ' initial clicks by leveraging various kinds of signals , how to engage such users algorithmically after their initial visit is largely under-explored . In this paper , we study the problem of post-click news recommendation . Given that a user has perused a current news article , our idea is to automatically identify `` related '' news articles which the user would like to read afterwards . Specifically , we propose to characterize relatedness between news articles across four aspects : relevance , novelty , connection clarity , and transition smoothness . Motivated by this understanding , we define a set of features to capture each of these aspects and put forward a learning approach to model relatedness . In order to quantitatively evaluate our proposed measures and learn a unified relatedness function , we construct a large test collection based on a four-month commercial news corpus with editorial judgments . The experimental results show that the proposed heuristics can indeed capture relatedness , and that the learned unified relatedness function works quite effectively .", "488626": "Generating query substitutions . We introduce the notion of query substitution , that is , generating a new query to replace a user 's original search query . Our technique uses modifications based on typical substitutions web searchers make to their queries . In this way the new query is strongly related to the original query , containing terms closely related to all of the original terms . This contrasts with query expansion through pseudo-relevance feedback , which is costly and can lead to query drift . This also contrasts with query relaxation through boolean or TFIDF retrieval , which reduces the specificity of the query . We define a scale for evaluating query substitution , and show that our method performs well at generating new queries related to the original queries . We build a model for selecting between candidates , by using a number of features relating the query-candidate pair , and by fitting the model to human judgments of relevance of query suggestions . This further improves the quality of the candidates generated .

Named entity recognition studies the problem of locating and classifying parts of free text into a set of predefined categories . Although extensive research has focused on the detection of person , location and organization entities , there are many other entities of interest , including phone numbers , dates , times and currencies ( to name a few examples ) . We refer to these types of entities as `` semi-structured named entities '' , since they usually follow certain syntactic formats according to some conventions , although their structure is typically not well-defined . Regular expression solutions require significant amount of manual effort and supervised machine learning approaches rely on large sets of labeled training data . Therefore , these approaches do not scale when we need to support many semi-structured entity types in many languages and regions . In this paper , we study this problem and propose a novel three-level bootstrapping framework for the detection of semi-structured entities . We describe the proposed techniques for phone , date and time entities , and perform extensive evaluations on English , German , Polish , Swedish and Turkish documents . Despite the minimal input from the user , our approach can achieve 95 % precision and 84 % recall for phone entities , and 94 % precision and 81 % recall for date and time entities , on average .

We consider the problem of template-independent news extraction . The state-of-the-art news extraction method is based on template-level wrapper induction , which has two serious limitations . 1 ) It can not correctly extract pages belonging to an unseen template until the wrapper for that template has been generated . 2 ) It is costly to maintain up-to-date wrappers for hundreds of websites , because any change of a template may lead to the invalidation of the corresponding wrapper . In this paper we formalize news extraction as a machine learning problem and learn a template-independent wrapper using a very small number of labeled news pages from a single site . Novel features dedicated to news titles and bodies are developed respectively . Correlations between the news title and the news body are exploited .

Leveraging clickthrough data has become a popular approach for evaluating and optimizing information retrieval systems . Although data is plentiful , one must take care when interpreting clicks , since user behavior can be affected by various sources of presentation bias . While the issue of position bias in clickthrough data has been the topic of much study , other presentation bias effects have received comparatively little attention . For instance , since users must decide whether to click on a result based on its summary ( e.g. , the title , URL and abstract ) , one might expect clicks to favor `` more attractive '' results . In this paper , we examine result summary attractiveness as a potential source of presentation bias . This study distinguishes itself from prior work by aiming to detect systematic biases in click behavior due to attractive summaries inflating perceived relevance . Our experiments conducted on the Google web search engine show substantial evidence of presentation bias in clicks towards results with more attractive titles .", "8786867": "Semantic email .

Anonymization of social networks before they are published or shared has become an important research question .

We study the problem of repeatedly publishing social network data as the network evolves , while preserving privacy of users . Publishing multiple instances of the same network independently has privacy risks , since stitching the information together may allow an adversary to identify users in the networks . We propose methods to anonymize a dynamic network such that the privacy of users is preserved when new nodes and edges are added to the published network .

The location-representative information in travelogues can greatly facilitate other tourists ' trip planning , if it can be correctly extracted and summarized . However , since most travelogues are unstructured and contain much noise , it is difficult for common users to utilize such knowledge effectively . In this paper , to mine location-representative knowledge from a large collection of travelogues , we propose a probabilistic topic model , named as Location-Topic model . This model has the advantages of ( 1 ) differentiability between two kinds of topics , i.e. , local topics which characterize locations and global topics which represent other common themes shared by various locations , and ( 2 ) representation of locations in the local topic space to encode both location-representative knowledge and similarities between locations .

Since each keystroke of the user could invoke a query on the backend , we need efficient algorithms to process each query within milliseconds .

Access to realistic , complex graph datasets is critical to research on social networking systems and applications . Simulations on graph data provide critical evaluation of new systems and applications ranging from community detection to spam filtering and social web search . Due to the high time and resource costs of gathering real graph datasets through direct measurements , researchers are anonymizing and sharing a small number of valuable datasets with the community . However , performing experiments using shared real datasets faces three key disadvantages : concerns that graphs can be de-anonymized to reveal private information , increasing costs of distributing large datasets , and that a small number of available social graphs limits the statistical confidence in the results . The use of measurement-calibrated graph models is an attractive alternative to sharing datasets . Researchers can `` fit '' a graph model to a real social graph , extract a set of model parameters , and use them to generate multiple synthetic graphs statistically similar to the original graph . While numerous graph models have been proposed , it is unclear if they can produce synthetic graphs that accurately match the properties of the original graphs . In this paper , we explore the feasibility of measurement-calibrated synthetic graphs using six popular graph models and a variety of real social graphs gathered from the Facebook social network ranging from 30,000 to 3 million edges . We find that two models consistently produce synthetic graphs with common graph metric values similar to those of the original graphs . However , only one produces high fidelity results in our application-level benchmarks . While this shows that graph models can produce realistic synthetic graphs , it also highlights the fact that current graph metrics remain incomplete , and some applications expose graph properties that do not map to existing metrics .", "9266154": "Structuring namespace descriptions .

An object on the Semantic Web is likely to be denoted with multiple URIs by different parties . Object coreference resolution is to identify `` equivalent '' URIs that denote the same object . Driven by the Linking Open Data ( LOD ) initiative , millions of URIs have been explicitly linked with owl : sameAs statements , but potentially coreferent ones are still considerable . Existing approaches address the problem mainly from two directions : one is based upon equivalence inference mandated by OWL semantics , which finds semantically coreferent URIs but probably omits many potential ones ; the other is via similarity computation between property-value pairs , which is not always accurate enough . In this paper , we propose a self-training approach for object coreference resolution on the Semantic Web , which leverages the two classes of approaches to bridge the gap between semantically coreferent URIs and potential candidates . For an object URI , we firstly establish a kernel that consists of semantically coreferent URIs based on owl : sameAs , ( inverse ) functional properties and ( max - ) cardinalities , and then extend such kernel iteratively in terms of discriminative property-value pairs in the descriptions of URIs . In particular , the discriminability is learned with a statistical measurement , which not only exploits key characteristics for representing an object , but also takes into account the matchability between properties from pragmatics . In addition , frequent property combinations are mined to improve the accuracy of the resolution . We implement a scalable system and demonstrate that our approach achieves good precision and recall for resolving object coreference , on both benchmark and large-scale datasets .", "5424255": "Wake-on-WLAN .

In commerce search , the set of products returned by a search engine often forms the basis for all user interactions leading up to a potential transaction on the web . Such a set of products is known as the consideration set . In this study , we consider the problem of generating consideration set of products in commerce search so as to maximize user satisfaction . One of the key features of commerce search that we exploit in our study is the association of a set of important attributes with the products and a set of specified attributes with the user queries . Those important attributes not used in the query are treated as unspecified . The attribute space admits a natural definition of user satisfaction via user preferences on the attributes and their values , viz . require that the surfaced products be close to the specified attribute values in the query , and diverse with respect to the unspecified attributes . We model this as a general Max-Sum Dispersion problem wherein we are given a set of n nodes in a metric space and the objective is to select a subset of nodes with total cost at most a given budget , and maximize the sum of the pairwise distances between the selected nodes . In our setting , each node denotes a product , the cost of a node being inversely proportional to its relevance with respect to specified attributes . The distance between two nodes quantifies the diversity with respect to the unspecified attributes . The problem is NP-hard and a 2-approximation was previously known only when all the nodes have unit cost . In our setting , we do not make any assumptions on the cost . We label this problem as the General Max-Sum Dispersion problem . We give the first constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem , achieving an approximation ratio of 2 .

The notion of relevance is key to the performance of search engines as they interpret the user queries and respond with matching results .

In document search , diversity is simply the variety of documents that span the result set . In an online marketplace the diversity in the result set is represented by items for sale by different sellers at different prices with different sales options . For such a marketplace , in order to minimize query abandonment and the risk of dissatisfaction to the average user , several factors like diversity , trust and value need to be taken into account .

On an abstract level , XML Schema increases the limited expressive power of Document Type Definitions ( DTDs ) by extending them with a recursive typing mechanism . However , an investigation of the XML Schema Definitions ( XSDs ) occurring in practice reveals that the vast majority of them are structurally equivalent to DTDs . This might be due to the complexity of the XML Schema specification and the difficulty to understand the effect of constraints on typing and validation of schemas . To shed some light on the actual expressive power of XSDs this paper studies the impact of the Element Declarations Consistent ( EDC ) and the Unique Particle Attribution ( UPA ) rule . An equivalent formalism based on contextual patterns rather than on recursive types is proposed which might serve as a light-weight front end for XML Schema . Finally , the effect of EDC and UPA on the way XML documents can be typed is discussed . It is argued that a cleaner , more robust , stronger but equally efficient class is obtained by replacing EDC and UPA with the notion of 1-pass preorder typing : schemas that allow to determine the type of an element of a streaming document when its opening tag is met . This notion can be defined in terms of restrained competition regular expressions and there is again an equivalent syntactical formalism based on contextual patterns .", "8956046": "Personal TV viewing by using live chat as metadata .

A crucial step in adding structure to unstructured data is to identify references to entities and disambiguate them . Such disambiguated references can help enhance readability and draw similarities across different pieces of running text in an automated fashion . Previous research has tackled this problem by first forming a catalog of entities from a knowledge base , such as Wikipedia , and then using this catalog to disambiguate references in unseen text . However , most of the previously proposed models either do not use all text in the knowledge base , potentially missing out on discriminative features , or do not exploit word-entity proximity to learn high-quality catalogs . In this work , we propose topic models that keep track of the context of every word in the knowledge base ; so that words appearing within the same context as an entity are more likely to be associated with that entity . Thus , our topic models utilize all text present in the knowledge base and help learn high-quality catalogs . Our models also learn groups of co-occurring entities thus enabling collective disambiguation . Unlike most previous topic models , our models are non-parametric and do not require the user to specify the exact number of groups present in the knowledge base .

Providing video on demand ( VoD ) service over the Internet in a scalable way is a challenging problem . In this paper , we propose P2Cast - an architecture that uses a peer-to-peer approach to cooperatively stream video using patching techniques , while only relying on unicast connections among peers . We address the following two key technical issues in P2Cast : ( 1 ) constructing an application overlay appropriate for streaming ; and ( 2 ) providing continuous stream playback ( without glitches ) in the face of disruption from an early departing client . Our simulation experiments show that P2Cast can serve many more clients than traditional client-server unicast service , and that it generally out-performs multicast-based patching if clients can cache more than of a stream 's initial portion . We handle disruptions by delaying the start of playback and applying the shifted forwarding technique . A threshold on the length of time during which arriving clients are served in a single session in P2Cast serves as a knob to adjust the balance between the scalability and the clients ' viewing quality in P2Cast .", "10565631": "Mind the data skew : distributed inferencing by speeddating in elastic regions . Semantic Web data exhibits very skewed frequency distributions among terms . Efficient large-scale distributed reasoning methods should maintain load-balance in the face of such highly skewed distribution of input data . We show that term-based partitioning , used by most distributed reasoning approaches , has limited scalability due to load-balancing problems . We address this problem with a method for data distribution based on clustering in elastic regions . Instead of as - signing data to fixed peers , data flows semi-randomly in the network . Data items `` speed-date '' while being temporarily collocated in the same peer . We introduce a bias in the routing to allow semantically clustered neighborhoods to emerge . Our approach is self-organising , efficient and does not require any central coordination . We have implemented this method on the MaRVIN platform and have performed experiments on large real-world datasets , using a cluster of up to 64 nodes . We compute the RDFS closure over different datasets and show that our clustering algorithm drastically reduces computation time , calculating the RDFS closure of 200 million triples in 7.2 minutes .", "13544630": "Reliability analysis using weighted combinational models for web-based software .

Web search engines use indexes to efficiently retrieve pages containing specified query terms , as well as pages linking to specified pages . The problem of compressed indexes that permit such fast retrieval has a long history . We consider the problem : assuming that the terms in ( or links to ) a page are generated from a probability distribution , how well compactly can we build such indexes that allow fast retrieval ? Of particular interest is the case when the probability distribution is Zipfian ( or a similar power law ) , since these are the distributions that arise on the web . We obtain sharp bounds on the space requirement of Boolean indexes for text documents that follow Zipf 's law . In the process we develop a general technique that applies to any probability distribution , not necessarily a power law ; this is the first analysis of compression in indexes under arbitrary distributions . Our bounds lead to quantitative versions of rules of thumb that are folklore in indexing . Our experiments on several document collections show that the distribution of terms appears to follow a double-Pareto law rather than Zipf 's law .

Service Oriented Computing is emerging as the main approach to build distributed enterprise applications on the Web .

This is in contrast with existing approaches to access control enforcement that assume a Web service as a set of independent operations . Furthermore , our approach achieves a tradeoff between the need to protect Web service 's access control policies and the need to disclose to clients the portion of access control policies related to the conversations they are interested in . This is important to avoid situations where the client can not progress in the conversation due to the lack of required security requirements .

The other fragment contains question tokens which give clues about the answer type , and are expected to be replaced in the answer passage by tokens which specialize or instantiate the desired answer type .

In this paper , we introduce `` task trail '' as a new concept to understand user search behaviors . We define task to be an atomic user information need . Web search logs have been studied mainly at session or query level where users may submit several queries within one task and handle several tasks within one session . Although previous studies have addressed the problem of task identification , little is known about the advantage of using task over session and query for search applications . In this paper , we conduct extensive analyses and comparisons to evaluate the effectiveness of task trails in three search applications : determining user satisfaction , predicting user search interests , and query suggestion . Experiments are conducted on large scale datasets from a commercial search engine . Experimental results show that : ( 1 ) Sessions and queries are not as precise as tasks in determining user satisfaction .

Today the major web search engines answer queries by showing ten result snippets , which need to be inspected by users for identifying relevant results .

We treat users ' search trails ( i.e. , post-search browsing behaviors ) as implicit labels on the relevance between web contents and user queries . Based on such labels we use information extraction approach to build wrappers and extract structured information . An important observation is that many web sites contain pages for name entities of certain categories ( e.g. , AOL Music contains a page for each musician ) , and these pages have the same format . This makes it possible to build wrappers from a small amount of implicit labels , and use them to extract structured information from many web pages for different name entities . We propose STRUCLICK , a fully automated system for extracting structured information for queries containing name entities of certain categories . It can identify important web sites from web search logs , build wrappers from users ' search trails , filter out bad wrappers built from random user clicks , and combine structured information from different web sites for each query .

Gradient Boosted Regression Trees ( GBRT ) are the current state-of-the-art learning paradigm for machine learned web-search ranking - a domain notorious for very large data sets .

Our technique parallelizes the construction of the individual regression trees and operates using the master-worker paradigm as follows . The data are partitioned among the workers . At each iteration , the worker summarizes its data-partition using histograms . The master processor uses these to build one layer of a regression tree , and then sends this layer to the workers , allowing the workers to build histograms for the next layer . Our algorithm carefully orchestrates overlap between communication and computation to achieve good performance . Since this approach is based on data partitioning , and requires a small amount of communication , it generalizes to distributed and shared memory machines , as well as clouds . We present experimental results on both shared memory machines and clusters for two large scale web search ranking data sets . We demonstrate that the loss in accuracy induced due to the histogram approximation in the regression tree creation can be compensated for through slightly deeper trees . As a result , we see no significant loss in accuracy on the Yahoo data sets and a very small reduction in accuracy for the Microsoft LETOR data . In addition , on shared memory machines , we obtain almost perfect linear speed-up with up to about 48 cores on the large data sets .

This will give true mobility to the user as he\\/she will not be restricted to the time and location where he\\/she accesses an application . Of course , we need a variety of different mechanisms and technologies to enable this , such as : Remote rendering of UIs on other devices in the network . Infrastructure for discovering client and servers in a network . Mechanisms to exchange capability information between devices , and to adapt the UI based on these capabilities . Mechanisms to deal with session migration . Support for a wide range of consumer devices , ranging from mobile phones to high-end TVs . This requires technologies that cross different domains , i.e. the PC domain , mobile domain , and TV domain . Several major companies within these different domains have decided to work together on these issues .

Recent research provides evidence for the presence of emergent semantics in collaborative tagging systems . While several methods have been proposed , little is known about the factors that influence the evolution of semantic structures in these systems . A natural hypothesis is that the quality of the emergent semantics depends on the pragmatics of tagging : Users with certain usage patterns might contribute more to the resulting semantics than others . In this work , we propose several measures which enable a pragmatic differentiation of taggers by their degree of contribution to emerging semantic structures . We distinguish between categorizers , who typically use a small set of tags as a replacement for hierarchical classification schemes , and describers , who are annotating resources with a wealth of freely associated , descriptive keywords . To study our hypothesis , we apply semantic similarity measures to 64 different partitions of a real-world and large-scale folksonomy containing different ratios of categorizers and describers . Our results not only show that `` verbose '' taggers are most useful for the emergence of tag semantics , but also that a subset containing only 40 % of the most ` verbose ' taggers can produce results that match and even outperform the semantic precision obtained from the whole dataset . Moreover , the results suggest that there exists a causal link between the pragmatics of tagging and resulting emergent semantics .

Grid computing -- the assemblage of heterogeneous distributed clusters of computers viewed as a single virtual machine -- promises to serve as the next major paradigm in distributed computing .

The current existing scheduling models range from static , where each of the programs is assigned once to a processor before execution of the program commences , to dynamic , where a program may be reassigned to different processors , or a hybrid approach , which combines characteristics of both techniques ( 1,4,5 ) . To address this issue , we have developed a JAVA based discrete event Grid simulator toolkit called HuskySim . The HuskySim toolkit provides core functionalities ( e.g. , compute objects , network objects , and scheduling objects ) that can be used to simulate a distributed computing environment . Furthermore , it can be used to predict the performance of various classes of Grid scheduling algorithms including : Static scheduling algorithms , Dynamic scheduling , Adaptive Scheduling . In our design , we adopted an object-oriented design , which allows an easy mapping and integration of simulation objects into the simulation program . This approach simplifies the simulation of multitasking , and distributed data processing model . Our model of multitasking processing is based on an interrupt driven mechanism . As shown in Figure 1 , the simulator works by relaying messages between the core engine and the simulation modules through the message handling sub-system . Once the architecture , the load distribution , and the scheduling algorithms are defined , the object registration subsystem sends a NEW OBJECT REQUEST MESSAGE to the object class libraries and builds a skeleton for the requested simulation experiment . Workloads traces can be generated using probabilistic models . The currently supported distributions are : Uniform , Poisson , Exponential , Normal , Erlang , and Power Tailed . It is also possible to use real world load traces . Moreover , we augmented the Simulator with a statistical module . Using the statistical module provided with the HuskySim , the core simulation engine can send messages to perform various type of analysis on the performance data including : variance reduction , regression , time series analysis , clustering , and data mining . In order to quantify the system performance , the simulator provides various performance metrics including : CPU utilization , disk utilization , application turnaround time , latency , make span , host to host bandwidth , jammed bandwidth , and TCP\\/IP traffic data .

In this paper , we propose two generative Bayesian models for semantic community discovery in SNs , combining probabilistic modeling with community detection in SNs . To simulate the generative models , an EnF-Gibbs sampling algorithm is proposed to address the efficiency and performance problems of traditional methods . Experimental studies on Enron email corpus show that our approach successfully detects the communities of individuals and in addition provides semantic topic descriptions of these communities .", "4063058": "A framework for determining necessary query set sizes to evaluate web search effectiveness . We describe a framework of bootstrapped hypothesis testing for estimating the confidence in one web search engine outperforming another over any randomly sampled query set of a given size .

Results from this bootstrapping approach over typical query set sizes indicate that examining repeated statistical tests is imperative , as a single test is quite likely to find significant differences that do not necessarily generalize . We also find that the number of queries needed for a repeatable evaluation in a dynamic environment such as the web is much higher than previously studied .", "13526814": "Mining cultural differences from a large number of geotagged photos .

The success of the Semantic Web depends on the availability of Web pages annotated with metadata .

In this paper we propose P-TAG , a method which automatically generates personalized tags for Web pages . Upon browsing a Web page , P-TAG produces keywords relevant both to its textual content , but also to the data residing on the surfer 's Desktop , thus expressing a personalized viewpoint . Empirical evaluations with several algorithms pursuing this approach showed very promising results .

We propose an indexing scheme called LSH Forest which is applicable in all the above contexts . Our index uses the well-known technique of locality-sensitive hashing ( LSH ) , but improves upon previous designs by ( a ) eliminating the different data-dependent parameters for which LSH must be constantly hand-tuned , and ( b ) improving on LSH 's performance guarantees for skewed data distributions while retaining the same storage and query overhead .

For a product in the catalog , say Ricoh G600 Digital Camera , we want to associate etags such as `` water resistant '' , `` rugged '' and `` outdoor '' to it , even though its name or description does not mention those phrases .

We propose new evaluation metrics for search result diversification that considers this distinction , as well as a simple method for comparing the intuitiveness of a given pair of metrics quantitatively . Our main experimental findings are : ( a ) In terms of discriminative power which reflects statistical reliability , the proposed metrics , DIN # - nDCG and P+Q # , are comparable to intent recall and D # - nDCG , and possibly superior to \u03b1-nDCG ; ( b ) In terms of preference agreement with intent recall , P+Q # is superior to other diversity metrics and therefore may be the most intuitive as a metric that emphasises diversity ; and ( c ) In terms of preference agreement with effective precision , DIN # - nDCG is superior to other diversity metrics and therefore may be the most intuitive as a metric that emphasises relevance . Moreover , DIN # - nDCG may be the most intuitive as a metric that considers both diversity and relevance . In addition , we demonstrate that the randomised Tukey 's Honestly Significant Differences test that takes the entire set of available runs into account is substantially more conservative than the paired bootstrap test that only considers one run pair at a time , and therefore recommend the former approach for significance testing when a set of runs is available for evaluation .", "13543053": "Visual diversification of image search results .

Online social networks have become very popular in recent years and their number of users is already measured in many hundreds of millions .

The proposed schemes are also applicable for estimating the sizes of networks ' sub-populations . The suggested algorithms interact with the social networks via their public APIs only , and rely on no other external information . Due to obvious traffic and privacy concerns , the number of such interactions is severely limited . We therefore focus on minimizing the number of API interactions needed for producing good size estimates . We adopt the abstraction of social networks as undirected graphs and use random node sampling . By counting the number of collisions or non-unique nodes in the sample , we produce a size estimate . Then , we show analytically that the estimate error vanishes with high probability for smaller number of samples than those required by prior-art algorithms . Moreover , although our algorithms are provably correct for any graph , they excel when applied to social network-like graphs .

An annotation is a short description of the contents of a web page , which can be considered a substitute for anchor text .

The segments discovered by our scheme help understand this underlying grammatical structure . We apply a statistical model based on Hoeffding 's Inequality to mine significant word n-grams from queries and subsequently use them for segmenting the queries . Evaluation against manually segmented queries shows that this technique can detect rare units that are missed by our Pointwise Mutual Information ( PMI ) baseline .", "14389008": "Mr. LDA : a flexible large scale topic modeling package using variational inference in MapReduce .

As opposed to other techniques which use Gibbs sampling , our proposed framework uses variational inference , which easily fits into a distributed environment . More importantly , this variational implementation , unlike highly tuned and specialized implementations based on Gibbs sampling , is easily extensible . We demonstrate two extensions of the models possible with this scalable framework : informed priors to guide topic discovery and extracting topics from a multilingual corpus .

With the explosive growth of digital cameras and online media , it has become crucial to design efficient methods that help users browse and search large image collections . The recent VisualRank algorithm ( 4 ) employs visual similarity to represent the link structure in a graph so that the classic PageRank algorithm can be applied to select the most relevant images . However , measuring visual similarity is difficult when there exist diversified semantics in the image collection , and the results from VisualRank can not supply good visual summarization with diversity . This paper proposes to rank the images in a structural fashion , which aims to discover the diverse structure embedded in photo collections , and rank the images according to their similarity among local neighborhoods instead of across the entire photo collection . We design a novel algorithm named RankCompete , which generalizes the PageRank algorithm for the task of simultaneous ranking and clustering .

Large-scale text categorization is an important research topic for Web data mining . One of the challenges in large-scale text categorization is how to reduce the human efforts in labeling text documents for building reliable classification models . In the past , there have been many studies on applying active learning methods to automatic text categorization , which try to select the most informative documents for labeling manually . Most of these studies focused on selecting a single unlabeled document in each iteration . As a result , the text categorization model has to be retrained after each labeled document is solicited . In this paper , we present a novel active learning algorithm that selects a batch of text documents for labeling manually in each iteration . The key of the batch mode active learning is how to reduce the redundancy among the selected examples such that each example provides unique information for model updating . To this end , we use the Fisher information matrix as the measurement of model uncertainty and choose the set of documents to effectively maximize the Fisher information of a classification model . Extensive experiments with three different datasets have shown that our algorithm is more effective than the state-of-the-art active learning techniques for text categorization and can be a promising tool toward large-scale text categorization for World Wide Web documents .", "13538488": "Rare item detection in e-commerce site .

Recommender systems are an important component of many websites . Two of the most popular approaches are based on matrix factorization ( MF ) and Markov chains ( MC ) . MF methods learn the general taste of a user by factorizing the matrix over observed user-item preferences . On the other hand , MC methods model sequential behavior by learning a transition graph over items that is used to predict the next action based on the recent actions of a user . In this paper , we present a method bringing both approaches together . Our method is based on personalized transition graphs over underlying Markov chains . That means for each user an own transition matrix is learned - thus in total the method uses a transition cube . As the observations for estimating the transitions are usually very limited , our method factorizes the transition cube with a pairwise interaction model which is a special case of the Tucker Decomposition . We show that our factorized personalized MC ( FPMC ) model subsumes both a common Markov chain and the normal matrix factorization model . For learning the model parameters , we introduce an adaption of the Bayesian Personalized Ranking ( BPR ) framework for sequential basket data . Empirically , we show that our FPMC model outperforms both the common matrix factorization and the unpersonalized MC model both learned with and without factorization .", "4300984": "A content-driven reputation system for the wikipedia .

Thus , author reputation is computed solely on the basis of content evolution ; user-to-user comments or ratings are not used . The author reputation we compute could be used to flag new contributions from low-reputation authors , or it could be used to allow only authors with high reputation to contribute to controversialor critical pages .

WS-BPEL defines a standard for executable processes . Executable processes are business processes which can be automated through an IT infrastructure .

Nevertheless , the WS-BPEL specification introduces a notion of compatibility between such an under-specified abstract process and a fully specified executable one . Basically , this compatibility notion defines a set of syntactical rules that can be augmented or restricted by profiles . So far , there exist two of such profiles : the Abstract Process Profile for Observable Behavior and the Abstract Process Profile for Templates . None of these profiles defines a concept of behavioral equivalence . Therefore , both profiles are too strict with respect to the rules they impose when deciding whether an executable process is compatible to an abstract one .

An interesting characteristic of many newsgroups is that people more frequently respond to a message when they disagree than when they agree . This behavior is in sharp contrast to the WWW link graph , where linkage is an indicator of agreement or common interest . By analyzing the graph structure of the responses , we are able to effectively classify people into opposite camps .

The improvement of continuous search queries may concern not only the quality of retrieved results but also the freshness of results , i.e. the time between the availability of a respective data object on the Web and the notification of a user by the search engine . In some cases a user should be notified immediately since the value of the respective information decreases quickly , as e.g. news about companies that affect the value of respective stocks , or sales offers for products that may no longer be available after a short period of time . In the document filtering literature , the optimization of such queries is usually based on threshold classification . Documents above a quality threshold are returned to a user . The threshold is tuned in order to optimize the quality of retrieved results . The disadvantage of such approaches is that the amount of information returned to a user may hardly be controlled without further user-interaction . In this paper , we consider the optimization of bounded continuous search queries where only the estimated best k elements are returned to a user . We present a new optimization method for bounded continuous search queries based on the optimal stopping theory and compare the new method to methods currently applied by Web search systems . The new method provides results of significantly higher quality for the cases where very fresh results have to be delivered .", "1167068": "Semantic virtual environments .

Malicious web pages that host drive-by-download exploits have become a popular means for compromising hosts on the Internet and , subsequently , for creating large-scale botnets . In a drive-by-download exploit , an attacker embeds a malicious script ( typically written in JavaScript ) into a web page . When a victim visits this page , the script is executed and attempts to compromise the browser or one of its plugins . To detect drive-by-download exploits , researchers have developed a number of systems that analyze web pages for the presence of malicious code . Most of these systems use dynamic analysis . That is , they run the scripts associated with a web page either directly in a real browser ( running in a virtualized environment ) or in an emulated browser , and they monitor the scripts ' executions for malicious activity . While the tools are quite precise , the analysis process is costly , often requiring in the order of tens of seconds for a single page . Therefore , performing this analysis on a large set of web pages containing hundreds of millions of samples can be prohibitive . One approach to reduce the resources required for performing large-scale analysis of malicious web pages is to develop a fast and reliable filter that can quickly discard pages that are benign , forwarding to the costly analysis tools only the pages that are likely to contain malicious code . In this paper , we describe the design and implementation of such a filter . Our filter , called Prophiler , uses static analysis techniques to quickly examine a web page for malicious content . This analysis takes into account features derived from the HTML contents of a page , from the associated JavaScript code , and from the corresponding URL . We automatically derive detection models that use these features using machine-learning techniques applied to labeled datasets . To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Prophiler , we crawled and collected millions of pages , which we analyzed for malicious behavior . Our results show that our filter is able to reduce the load on a more costly dynamic analysis tools by more than 85 % , with a negligible amount of missed malicious pages .", "10581378": "Empirical comparison of algorithms for network community detection . Detecting clusters or communities in large real-world graphs such as large social or information networks is a problem of considerable interest . In practice , one typically chooses an objective function that captures the intuition of a network cluster as set of nodes with better internal connectivity than external connectivity , and then one applies approximation algorithms or heuristics to extract sets of nodes that are related to the objective function and that `` look like '' good communities for the application of interest . In this paper , we explore a range of network community detection methods in order to compare them and to understand their relative performance and the systematic biases in the clusters they identify . We evaluate several common objective functions that are used to formalize the notion of a network community , and we examine several different classes of approximation algorithms that aim to optimize such objective functions . In addition , rather than simply fixing an objective and asking for an approximation to the best cluster of any size , we consider a size-resolved version of the optimization problem . Considering community quality as a function of its size provides a much finer lens with which to examine community detection algorithms , since objective functions and approximation algorithms often have non-obvious size-dependent behavior .", "92127": "Description logic programs : combining logic programs with description logic .

Conversely , the DLP-fusion technique likewise enables one to `` build ontologies on top of rules '' : it enables ontological definitions to be supplemented by rules , or imported into DL from rules .

Computing the degree of semantic relatedness of words is a key functionality of many language applications such as search , clustering , and disambiguation . Previous approaches to computing semantic relatedness mostly used static language resources , while essentially ignoring their temporal aspects . We believe that a considerable amount of relatedness information can also be found in studying patterns of word usage over time . Consider , for instance , a newspaper archive spanning many years . Two words such as `` war '' and `` peace '' might rarely co-occur in the same articles , yet their patterns of use over time might be similar . In this paper , we propose a new semantic relatedness model , Temporal Semantic Analysis ( TSA ) , which captures this temporal information . The previous state of the art method , Explicit Semantic Analysis ( ESA ) , represented word semantics as a vector of concepts . TSA uses a more refined representation , where each concept is no longer scalar , but is instead represented as time series over a corpus of temporally-ordered documents . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to incorporate temporal evidence into models of semantic relatedness . Empirical evaluation shows that TSA provides consistent improvements over the state of the art ESA results on multiple benchmarks .", "13833456": "Modeling the temporal dynamics of social rating networks using bidirectional effects of social relations and rating patterns . A social rating network ( SRN ) is a social network in which edges represent social relationships and users ( nodes ) express ratings on some of the given items . Such networks play an increasingly important role in reviewing websites such as Epinions.com or online sharing websites like Flickr.com . In this paper , we first observe and analyze the temporal behavior of users in a social rating network , who express ratings and create social relations . Then , we model the temporal dynamics of an SRN based on our observations , using the bidirectional effects of ratings and social relations . While existing models for other types of social networks have captured some of the effects , our model is the first one to represent all four effects , i.e. social relations-on-ratings ( social influence ) , social relations-on-social relations ( transitivity ) , ratings-on-social relations ( selection ) , and ratings-on-ratings ( correlational influence ) . Existing works consider these effects as static and constant throughout the evolution of an SRN , however our observations reveal that these effects are actually dynamic . We propose a probabilistic generative model for SRNs , which models the strength and dynamics of each effect throughout the network evolution . This model can serve for the prediction of future links , ratings or community structures . Due to the sensitive nature of SRNs , another motivation for our work is the generation of synthetic SRN data sets for research purposes .

Portlets ( i.e. multi-step , user-facing applications to be syndicated within a portal ) are currently supported by most portal frameworks . However , there is not yet a definitive answer to portlet interoperation whereby data flows smoothly from one portlet to a neighbouring one . Both data-based and API-based approaches exhibit some drawbacks in either the limitation of the sharing scope or the standardization effort required . We argue that these limitations can be overcome by using deep annotation techniques . By providing additional markup about the background services , deep annotation strives to interact with these underlying services rather than with the HTML surface that conveys the markup . In this way , the portlet producer can extend a portlet markup , a fragment , with data about the processes whose rendering this fragment supports . Then , the portlet consumer ( e.g. a portal ) can use deep annotation to map an output process in fragment A to an input process in fragment B. This mapping results in fragment B having its input form ( or other `` input '' widget ) filled up . We consider deep annotation as particularly valid for portlet interoperation due to the controlled and cooperative environment that characterizes the portal setting .", "1229684": "Bridging the gap between OWL and relational databases .

Acquiring followers not only increases the size of a user 's direct audience , but also contributes to the perceived influence of the user , which in turn impacts the ranking of the user 's tweets by search engines . In this paper , we first investigate link farming in the Twitter network and then explore mechanisms to discourage the activity . To this end , we conducted a detailed analysis of links acquired by over 40,000 spammer accounts suspended by Twitter . We find that link farming is wide spread and that a majority of spammers ' links are farmed from a small fraction of Twitter users , the social capitalists , who are themselves seeking to amass social capital and links by following back anyone who follows them . Our findings shed light on the social dynamics that are at the root of the link farming problem in Twitter network and they have important implications for future designs of link spam defenses .

With the recent explosive growth of the number of videos on the Web , it becomes more important to facilitate users ' demand for locating their preferred event clips in the lengthy and voluminous programs . Although there has been a great deal of study on generic event detection in recent years , the performance of existing approaches is still far from satisfactory . In this paper , we propose an integrated framework for general event detection . The key idea is that we utilize the synchronous comments to segment the video into clips with semantic text analysis , while taking into account the relationship between the users who write the comments . By borrowing the power of `` the wisdom of crowds '' , we experimentally demonstrate that our approach can effectively detect video events .", "6158247": "Ranking refinement and its application to information retrieval . We consider the problem of ranking refinement , i.e. , to improve the accuracy of an existing ranking function with a small set of labeled instances . We are , particularly , interested in learning a better ranking function using two complementary sources of information , ranking information given by the existing ranking function ( i.e. , a base ranker ) and that obtained from users ' feedbacks . This problem is very important in information retrieval where the feedback is gradually collected . The key challenge in combining the two sources of information arises from the fact that the ranking information presented by the base ranker tends to be imperfect and the ranking information obtained from users ' feedbacks tends to be noisy . We present a novel boosting framework for ranking refinement that can effectively leverage the uses of the two sources of information . Our empirical study shows that the proposed algorithm is effective for ranking refinement , and furthermore significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms that incorporate the outputs from the base ranker as an additional feature .", "1150148": "CS AKTive space : representing computer science in the semantic web .

This paper proposes and evaluates a Network Aware Forward Caching approach for determining the optimal deployment strategy of forward caches to a network . A key advantage of this approach is that we can reduce the network costs associated with forward caching to maximize the benefit obtained from their deployment . We show in our simulation that a 37 % increase to net benefits could be achieved over the standard method of full cache deployment to cache all POPs traffic . In addition , we show that this maximal point occurs when only 68 % of the total traffic is cached . Another contribution of this paper is the analysis we use to motivate and evaluate this problem . We characterize the Internet traffic of 100K subscribers of a US residential broadband provider . We use both layer 4 and layer 7 analysis to investigate the traffic volumes of the flows as well as study the general characteristics of the applications used . We show that HTTP is a dominant protocol and account for 68 % of the total downstream traffic and that 34 % of that traffic is multimedia . In addition , we show that multimedia content using HTTP exhibits a 83 % annualized growth rate and other HTTP traffic has a 53 % growth rate versus the 26 % over all annual growth rate of broadband traffic . This shows that HTTP traffic will become ever more dominent and increase the potential caching opportunities . Furthermore , we characterize the core backbone traffic of this broadband provider to measure the distance traveled by content and traffic . We find that CDN traffic is much more efficient than P2P content and that there is large skew in the Air Miles between POP in a typical network . Our findings show that there are many opportunties in broadband provider networks to optimize how traffic is delivered and cached .", "4277967": "pTHINC : a thin-client architecture for mobile wireless web .

This paper uses the URL word breaking task as an example to elaborate what we identify as crucial in designing statistical natural language processing ( NLP ) algorithms for Web scale applications : ( 1 ) rudimentary multilingual capabilities to cope with the global nature of the Web , ( 2 ) multi-style modeling to handle diverse language styles seen in the Web contents , ( 3 ) fast adaptation to keep pace with the dynamic changes of the Web , ( 4 ) minimal heuristic assumptions for generalizability and robustness , and ( 5 ) possibilities of efficient implementations and minimal manual efforts for processing massive amount of data at a reasonable cost . We first show that the state-of-the-art word breaking techniques can be unified and generalized under the Bayesian minimum risk ( BMR ) framework that , using a Web scale N-gram , can meet the first three requirements . We discuss how the existing techniques can be viewed as introducing additional assumptions to the basic BMR framework , and describe a generic yet efficient implementation called word synchronous beam search . Testing the framework and its implementation on a series of large scale experiments reveals the following . First , the language style used to build the model plays a critical role in the word breaking task , and the most suitable for the URL word breaking task appears to be that of the document title where the best performance is obtained . Models created from other language styles , such as from document body , anchor text , and even queries , exhibit varying degrees of mismatch . Although all styles benefit from increasing modeling power which , in our experiments , corresponds to the use of a higher order N-gram , the gain is most recognizable for the title model . The heuristics proposed by the prior arts do contribute to the word breaking performance for mismatched or less powerful models , but are less effective and , in many cases , lead to poorer performance than the matched model with minimal assumptions . For the matched model based on document titles , an accuracy rate of 97.18 % can already be achieved using simple trigram without any heuristics .", "4451497": "Temporal rules for mobile web personalization .

Web pages are usually highly structured documents . In some documents , content with different functionality is laid out in blocks , some merely supporting the main discourse . In other documents , there may be several blocks of unrelated main content . Indexing a web page as if it were a linear document can cause problems because of the diverse nature of its content . If the retrieval function treats all blocks of the web page equally without attention to structure , it may lead to irrelevant query matches . In this paper , we describe how content quality of different blocks of a web page can be utilized to improve a retrieval function . Our method is based on segmenting a web page into semantically coherent blocks and learning a predictor of segment content quality . We also describe how to use segment content quality estimates as weights in the BM25F formulation . Experimental results show our method improves relevance of retrieved results by as much as 4.5 % compared to BM25F that treats the body of a web page as a single section , and by a larger margin of over 9 % for difficult queries .", "3600639": "Topic segmentation of message hierarchies for indexing and navigation support . Message hierarchies in web discussion boards grow with new postings . Threads of messages evolve as new postings focus within or diverge from the original themes of the threads . Thus , just by investigating the subject headings or contents of earlier postings in a message thread , one may not be able to guess the contents of the later postings . The resulting navigation problem is further compounded for blind users who need the help of a screen reader program that can provide only a linear representation of the content . We see that , in order to overcome the navigation obstacle for blind as well as sighted users , it is essential to develop techniques that help identify how the content of a discussion board grows through generalizations and specializations of topics . This knowledge can be used in segmenting the content in coherent units and guiding the users through segments relevant to their navigational goals . Our experimental results showed that the segmentation algorithm described in this paper provides up to 80-85 % success rate in labeling messages . The algorithm is being deployed in a software system to reduce the navigational load of blind students in accessing web-based electronic course materials ; however , we note that the techniques are equally applicable for developing web indexing and summarization tools for users with sight .", "14316716": "Crowdsourcing with endogenous entry . We investigate the design of mechanisms to incentivize high quality outcomes in crowdsourcing environments with strategic agents , when entry is an endogenous , strategic choice . Modeling endogenous entry in crowdsourcing markets is important because there is a nonzero cost to making a contribution of any quality which can be avoided by not participating , and indeed many sites based on crowdsourced content do not have adequate participation . We use a mechanism with monotone , rank-based , rewards in a model where agents strategically make participation and quality choices to capture a wide variety of crowdsourcing environments , ranging from conventional crowdsourcing contests with monetary rewards such as TopCoder , to crowdsourced content as in online Q&A forums . We begin by explicitly constructing the unique mixed-strategy equilibrium for such monotone rank-order mechanisms , and use the participation probability and distribution of qualities from this construction to address the question of designing incentives for two kinds of rewards that arise in the context of crowdsourcing . We first show that for attention rewards that arise in the crowdsourced content setting , the entire equilibrium distribution and therefore every increasing statistic including the maximum and average quality ( accounting for participation ) , improves when the rewards for every rank but the last are as high as possible . In particular , when the cost of producing the lowest possible quality content is low , the optimal mechanism displays all but the poorest contribution . We next investigate how to allocate rewards in settings where there is a fixed total reward that can be arbitrarily distributed amongst participants , as in crowdsourcing contests . Unlike models with exogenous entry , here the expected number of participants can be increased by subsidizing entry , which could potentially improve the expected value of the best contribution . However , we show that subsidizing entry does not improve the expected quality of the best contribution , although it may improve the expected quality of the average contribution . In fact , we show that free entry is dominated by taxing entry -- making all entrants pay a small fee , which is rebated to the winner along with whatever rewards were already assigned , can improve the quality of the best contribution over a winner-take-all contest with no taxes .", "14426843": "D2RQ\\/update : updating relational data via virtual RDF .

The World-Wide Web consists not only of a huge number of unstructured texts , but also a vast amount of valuable structured data . Web tables ( 2 ) are a typical type of structured information that are pervasive on the web , and Web-scale methods that automatically extract web tables have been studied extensively ( 1 ) . Many powerful systems ( e.g. OCTOPUS ( 4 ) , Mesa ( 3 ) ) use extracted web tables as a fundamental component . In the database vernacular , a table is defined as a set of tuples which have the same attributes . Similarly , a web table is defined as a set of rows ( corresponding to database tuples ) which have the same column headers ( corresponding to database attributes ) . Therefore , to extract a web table is to extract a relation on the web . In databases , tables often contain foreign keys which refer to other tables . Therefore , it follows that hyperlinks inside a web table sometimes function as foreign keys to other relations whose tuples are contained in the hyperlink 's target pages . In this paper , we explore this idea by asking : can we discover new attributes for web tables by exploring hyperlinks inside web tables ? This poster proposes a solution that takes a web table as input . Frequent patterns are generated as new candidate relations by following hyperlinks in the web table . The confidence of candidates are evaluated , and trustworthy candidates are selected to become new attributes for the table .

Content sharing in social networks is a powerful mechanism for discovering content on the Internet .

In this paper , we propose novel algorithms for recommending connections that boost content propagation in a social network without compromising on the relevance of the recommendations . Unlike existing work on influence propagation , in our environment , we are looking for edges instead of nodes , with a bound on the number of incident edges per node . We show that the content spread function is not submodular , and develop approximation algorithms for computing a near-optimal set of edges .

Discovering mappings between concept hierarchies is widely regarded as one of the hardest and most urgent problems facing the Semantic Web . The problem is even harder in domains where concepts are inherently vague and ill-defined , and can not be given a crisp definition . A notion of approximate concept mapping is required in such domains , but until now , no such notion is vailable . The first contribution of this paper is a definition for approximate mappings between concepts . Roughly , a mapping between two concepts is decomposed into a number of submappings , and a sloppiness value determines the fraction of these submappings that can be ignored when establishing the mapping . A potential problem of such a definition is that with an increasing sloppiness value , it will gradually allow mappings between any two arbitrary concepts . To improve on this trivial behavior , we need to design a heuristic weighting which minimises the sloppiness required to conclude desirable matches , but at the same time maximises the sloppiness required to conclude undesirable matches . The second contribution of this paper is to show that a Google based similarity measure has exactly these desirable properties . We establish these results by experimental validation in the domain of musical genres . We show that this domain does suffer from ill-defined concepts . We take two real-life genre hierarchies from the Web , we compute approximate mappings between them at varying levels of sloppiness , and we validate our results against a handcrafted Gold Standard .

Bucket testing , also known as A\\/B testing , is a practice that is widely used by on-line sites with large audiences : in a simple version of the methodology , one evaluates a new feature on the site by exposing it to a very small fraction of the total user population and measuring its effect on this exposed group . For traditional uses of this technique , uniform independent sampling of the population is often enough to produce an exposed group that can serve as a statistical proxy for the full population . In on-line social network applications , however , one often wishes to perform a more complex test : evaluating a new social feature that will only produce an effect if a user and some number of his or her friends are exposed to it . In this case , independent uniform draws from the population will be unlikely to produce groups that contains users together with their friends , and so the construction of the sample must take the network structure into account . This leads quickly to challenging combinatorial problems , since there is an inherent tension between producing enough correlation to select users and their friends , but also enough uniformity and independence that the selected group is a reasonable sample of the full population . Here we develop an algorithmic framework for bucket testing in a network that addresses these challenges . First we describe a novel walk-based sampling method for producing samples of nodes that are internally well-connected but also approximately uniform over the population . Then we show how a collection of multiple independent subgraphs constructed this way can yield reasonable samples for testing .

Sentiment classification aims to automatically predict sentiment polarity ( e.g. , positive or negative ) of users publishing sentiment data ( e.g. , reviews , blogs ) .

Meanwhile , users often use some different words when they express sentiment in different domains .

In this cross-domain sentiment classification setting , to bridge the gap between the domains , we propose a spectral feature alignment ( SFA ) algorithm to align domain-specific words from different domains into unified clusters , with the help of domain-independent words as a bridge . In this way , the clusters can be used to reduce the gap between domain-specific words of the two domains , which can be used to train sentiment classifiers in the target domain accurately . Compared to previous approaches , SFA can discover a robust representation for cross-domain data by fully exploiting the relationship between the domain-specific and domain-independent words via simultaneously co-clustering them in a common latent space . We perform extensive experiments on two real world datasets , and demonstrate that SFA significantly outperforms previous approaches to cross-domain sentiment classification .", "375779": "Ranking definitions with supervised learning methods . This paper is concerned with the problem of definition search . Specifically , given a term , we are to retrieve definitional excerpts of the term and rank the extracted excerpts according to their likelihood of being good definitions . This is in contrast to the traditional approaches of either generating a single combined definition or simply outputting all retrieved definitions . Definition ranking is essential for the task . Methods for performing definition ranking are proposed in this paper , which formalize the problem as either classification or ordinal regression . A specification for judging the goodness of a definition is given . We employ SVM as the classification model and Ranking SVM as the ordinal regression model respectively , such that they rank definition candidates according to their likelihood of being good definitions . Features for constructing the SVM and Ranking SVM models are defined . An enterprise search system based on this method has been developed and has been put into practical use . Experimental results indicate that the use of SVM and Ranking SVM can significantly outperform the baseline methods of using heuristic rules or employing the conventional information retrieval method of Okapi . This is true both when the answers are paragraphs and when they are sentences . Experimental results also show that SVM or Ranking SVM models trained in one domain can be adapted to another domain , indicating that generic models for definition ranking can be constructed .", "5818562": "Efficient URL caching for world wide web crawling . Crawling the web is deceptively simple : the basic algorithm is ( a ) Fetch a page ( b ) Parse it to extract all linked URLs ( c ) For all the URLs not seen before , repeat ( a ) - ( c ) . However , the size of the web ( estimated at over 4 billion pages ) and its rate of change ( estimated at 7 % per week ) move this plan from a trivial programming exercise to a serious algorithmic and system design challenge . Indeed , these two factors alone imply that for a reasonably fresh and complete crawl of the web , step ( a ) must be executed about a thousand times per second , and thus the membership test ( c ) must be done well over ten thousand times per second against a set too large to store in main memory . This requires a distributed architecture , which further complicates the membership test . A crucial way to speed up the test is to cache , that is , to store in main memory a ( dynamic ) subset of the `` seen '' URLs . The main goal of this paper is to carefully investigate several URL caching techniques for web crawling . We consider both practical algorithms : random replacement , static cache , LRU , and CLOCK , and theoretical limits : clairvoyant caching and infinite cache . We performed about 1,800 simulations using these algorithms with various cache sizes , using actual log data extracted from a massive 33 day web crawl that issued over one billion HTTP requests . Our main conclusion is that caching is very effective - in our setup , a cache of roughly 50,000 entries can achieve a hit rate of almost 80 % . Interestingly , this cache size falls at a critical point : a substantially smaller cache is much less effective while a substantially larger cache brings little additional benefit . We conjecture that such critical points are inherent to our problem and venture an explanation for this phenomenon .", "31173": "Authoring and annotation of web pages in CREAM .

The process-driven composition of Web services is emerging as a promising approach to integrate business applications within and across organizational boundaries . In this approach , individual Web services are federated into composite Web services whose business logic is expressed as a process model . The tasks of this process model are essentially invocations to functionalities offered by the underlying component services . Usually , several component services are able to execute a given task , although with different levels of pricing and quality . In this paper , we advocate that the selection of component services should be carried out during the execution of a composite service , rather than at design-time . In addition , this selection should consider multiple criteria ( e.g. , price , duration , reliability ) , and it should take into account global constraints and preferences set by the user ( e.g. , budget constraints ) . Accordingly , the paper proposes a global planning approach to optimally select component services during the execution of a composite service . Service selection is formulated as an optimization problem which can be solved using efficient linear programming methods . Experimental results show that this global planning approach outperforms approaches in which the component services are selected individually for each task in a composite service .", "8956188": "ALVIN : a system for visualizing large networks .", "10074391": "Advertising keyword generation using active learning .

Large web search engines have to answer thousands of queries per second with interactive response times . Due to the sizes of the data sets involved , often in the range of multiple terabytes , a single query may require the processing of hundreds of megabytes or more of index data . To keep up with this immense workload , large search engines employ clusters of hundreds or thousands of machines , and a number of techniques such as caching , index compression , and index and query pruning are used to improve scalability . In particular , two-level caching techniques cache results of repeated identical queries at the frontend , while index data for frequently used query terms are cached in each node at a lower level . We propose and evaluate a three-level caching scheme that adds an intermediate level of caching for additional performance gains . This intermediate level attempts to exploit frequently occurring pairs of terms by caching intersections or projections of the corresponding inverted lists .

The ability to aggregate huge volumes of queries over a large population of users allows search engines to build precise models for a variety of query-assistance features such as query recommendation , correction , etc. . Yet , no matter how much data is aggregated , the long-tail distribution implies that a large fraction of queries are rare . As a result , most query assistance services perform poorly or are not even triggered on long-tail queries . We propose a method to extend the reach of query assistance techniques ( and in particular query recommendation ) to long-tail queries by reasoning about rules between query templates rather than individual query transitions , as currently done in query-flow graph models . As a simple example , if we recognize that ` Montezuma ' is a city in the rare query `` Montezuma surf '' and if the rule ` city surf \u2192 beach has been observed , we are able to offer `` Montezuma beach '' as a recommendation , even if the two queries were never observed in a same session . We conducted experiments to validate our hypothesis , first via traditional small-scale editorial assessments but more interestingly via a novel automated large scale evaluation methodology . Our experiments show that general coverage can be relatively increased by 24 % using templates without penalizing quality . Furthermore , for 36 % of the 95M queries in our query flow graph , which have no out edges and thus could not be served recommendations , we can now offer at least one recommendation in 98 % of the cases .", "4795633": "Analyzing web access control policies .

Privacy is an enormous problem in online social networking sites . While sites such as Facebook allow users fine-grained control over who can see their profiles , it is difficult for average users to specify this kind of detailed policy . In this paper , we propose a template for the design of a social networking privacy wizard . The intuition for the design comes from the observation that real users conceive their privacy preferences ( which friends should be able to see which information ) based on an implicit set of rules . Thus , with a limited amount of user input , it is usually possible to build a machine learning model that concisely describes a particular user 's preferences , and then use this model to configure the user 's privacy settings automatically . As an instance of this general framework , we have built a wizard based on an active learning paradigm called uncertainty sampling . The wizard iteratively asks the user to assign privacy `` labels '' to selected ( `` informative '' ) friends , and it uses this input to construct a classifier , which can in turn be used to automatically assign privileges to the rest of the user 's ( unlabeled ) friends . To evaluate our approach , we collected detailed privacy preference data from 45 real Facebook users . Our study revealed two important things . First , real users tend to conceive their privacy preferences in terms of communities , which can easily be extracted from a social network graph using existing techniques . Second , our active learning wizard , using communities as features , is able to recommend high-accuracy privacy settings using less user input than existing policy-specification tools .", "11708130": "Pragmatic evaluation of folksonomies . Recently , a number of algorithms have been proposed to obtain hierarchical structures - so-called folksonomies - from social tagging data . Work on these algorithms is in part driven by a belief that folksonomies are useful for tasks such as : ( a ) Navigating social tagging systems and ( b ) Acquiring semantic relationships between tags . While the promises and pitfalls of the latter have been studied to some extent , we know very little about the extent to which folksonomies are pragmatically useful for navigating social tagging systems . This paper sets out to address this gap by presenting and applying a pragmatic framework for evaluating folksonomies . We model exploratory navigation of a tagging system as decentralized search on a network of tags . Evaluation is based on the fact that the performance of a decentralized search algorithm depends on the quality of the background knowledge used . The key idea of our approach is to use hierarchical structures learned by folksonomy algorithm as background knowledge for decentralized search . Utilizing decentralized search on tag networks in combination with different folksonomies as hierarchical background knowledge allows us to evaluate navigational tasks in social tagging systems . Our experiments with four state-of-the-art folksonomy algorithms on five different social tagging datasets reveal that existing folksonomy algorithms exhibit significant , previously undiscovered , differences with regard to their utility for navigation . Our results are relevant for engineers aiming to improve navigability of social tagging systems and for scientists aiming to evaluate different folksonomy algorithms from a pragmatic perspective .", "5851594": "A combinatorial allocation mechanism with penalties for banner advertising . Most current banner advertising is sold through negotiation thereby incurring large transaction costs and possibly suboptimal allocations . We propose a new automated system for selling banner advertising . In this system , each advertiser specifies a collection of host webpages which are relevant to his product , a desired total quantity of impressions on these pages , and a maximum per-impression price . The system selects a subset of advertisers as ` winners ' and maps each winner to a set of impressions on pages within his desired collection . The distinguishing feature of our system as opposed to current combinatorial allocation mechanisms is that , mimicking the current negotiation system , we guarantee that winners receive at least as many advertising opportunities as they requested or else receive ample compensation in the form of a monetary payment by the host . Such guarantees are essential in markets like banner advertising where a major goal of the advertising campaign is developing brand recognition . As we show , the problem of selecting a feasible subset of advertisers with maximum total value is inapproximable . We thus present two greedy heuristics and discuss theoretical techniques to measure their performances . Our first algorithm iteratively selects advertisers and corresponding sets of impressions which contribute maximum marginal per-impression profit to the current solution . We prove a bi-criteria approximation for this algorithm , showing that it generates approximately as much value as the optimum algorithm on a slightly harder problem . However , this algorithm might perform poorly on instances in which the value of the optimum solution is quite large , a clearly undesirable failure mode . Hence , we present an adaptive greedy algorithm which again iteratively selects advertisers with maximum marginal per-impression profit , but additionally reassigns impressions at each iteration . For this algorithm , we prove a structural approximation result , a newly defined framework for evaluating heuristics ( 10 ) . We thereby prove that this algorithm has a better performance guarantee than the simple greedy algorithm .", "362327": "Schemapath , a minimal extension to xml schema for conditional constraints .

One major point of discrimination among schema languages is the support of co-constraints , or co-occurrence constraints , e.g. , requiring that attribute A is present if and only if attribute B is ( or is not ) presentin the same element .

Previously , we defined a mechanism called the value of changed information which measures the impact of expected changes in the service parameters on the Web process , thereby offering a way to query and incorporate those changes that are useful and cost-efficient .

Therefore , the optimized mechanism is more suitable for lightweight DDoS attacks detection in real network environment .", "3598766": "Towards autonomic web-sites based on learning automata . Autonomics or self-reorganization becomes pertinent for web-sites serving a large number of users with highly varying workloads . An important component of self-adaptation is to model the behavior of users and adapt accordingly . This paper proposes a learning-automata based technique for model discovery . User access patterns are used to construct an FSM model of user behavior that in turn is used for prediction and prefetching . The proposed technique uses a generalization algorithm to classify behavior patterns into a small number of generalized classes . It has been tested on both synthetic and live data-sets and has shown a prediction hit-rate of up to 89 % on a real web-site .", "11108002": "Incentivizing high-quality user-generated content . We model the economics of incentivizing high-quality user generated content ( UGC ) , motivated by settings such as online review forums , question-answer sites , and comments on news articles and blogs . We provide a game-theoretic model within which to study the problem of incentivizing high quality UGC , in which contributors are strategic and motivated by exposure . Our model has the feature that both the quality of contributions as well as the extent of participation is determined endogenously in a free-entry Nash equilibrium . The model predicts , as observed in practice , that if exposure is independent of quality , there will be a flood of low quality contributions in equilibrium . An ideal mechanism in this context would elicit both high quality and high participation in equilibrium , with near-optimal quality as the available attention diverges , and should be easily implementable in practice . We consider a very simple elimination mechanism , which subjects each contribution to rating by some number A of viewers , and eliminates any contributions that are not uniformly rated positively . We construct and analyze free-entry Nash equilibria for this mechanism , and show that A can be chosen to achieve quality that tends to optimal , along with diverging participation , as the number of viewers diverges .", "6205324": "Optimal marketing strategies over social networks . We discuss the use of social networks in implementing viral marketing strategies . While influence maximization has been studied in this context ( see Chapter 24 of ( 10 ) ) , we study revenue maximization , arguably , a more natural objective . In our model , a buyer 's decision to buy an item is influenced by the set of other buyers that own the item and the price at which the item is offered . We focus on algorithmic question of finding revenue maximizing marketing strategies . When the buyers are completely symmetric , we can find the optimal marketing strategy in polynomial time . In the general case , motivated by hardness results , we investigate approximation algorithms for this problem . We identify a family of strategies called influence-and-exploit strategies that are based on the following idea : Initially influence the population by giving the item for free to carefully a chosen set of buyers . Then extract revenue from the remaining buyers using a ` greedy ' pricing strategy . We first argue why such strategies are reasonable and then show how to use recently developed set-function maximization techniques to find the right set of buyers to influence .", "13756266": "Trust analysis with clustering . Web provides rich information about a variety of objects . Trustability is a major concern on the web . Truth establishment is an important task so as to provide the right information to the user from the most trustworthy source .

However , a single information provider may not be the most trustworthy for all kinds of information . Every information provider has its own area of competence where it can perform better than others . We derive a model that can evaluate trustability on objects and information providers based on clusters ( groups ) . We propose a method which groups the set of objects for which similar set of providers provide `` good '' facts , and provides better accuracy in addition to high quality object clusters .", "8941157": "Web engineering with the visual software circuit board .

Recent web search techniques augment traditional text matching with a global notion of `` importance '' based on the linkage structure of the web , such as in Google 's PageRank algorithm .

In this paper we study how to discover the evolution of topics over time in a time-stamped document collection . Our approach is uniquely designed to capture the rich topology of topic evolution inherent in the corpus . Instead of characterizing the evolving topics at fixed time points , we conceptually define a topic as a quantized unit of evolutionary change in content and discover topics with the time of their appearance in the corpus . Discovered topics are then connected to form a topic evolution graph using a measure derived from the underlying document network . Our approach allows inhomogeneous distribution of topics over time and does not impose any topological restriction in topic evolution graphs . We evaluate our algorithm on the ACM corpus . The topic evolution graphs obtained from the ACM corpus provide an effective and concrete summary of the corpus with remarkably rich topology that are congruent to our background knowledge .

Computer users are asked to generate , keep secret , and recall an increasing number of passwords for uses including host accounts , email servers , e-commerce sites , and online financial services . Unfortunately , the password entropy that users can comfortably memorize seems insufficient to store unique , secure passwords for all these accounts , and it is likely to remain constant as the number of passwords ( and the adversary 's computational power ) increases into the future . In this paper , we propose a technique that uses a strengthened cryptographic hash function to compute secure passwords for arbitrarily many accounts while requiring the user to memorize only a single short password . This mechanism functions entirely on the client ; no server-side changes are needed . Unlike previous approaches , our design is both highly resistant to brute force attacks and nearly stateless , allowing users to retrieve their passwords from any location so long as they can execute our program and remember a short secret .

Many techniques have been proposed to scale web applications . However , the data interdependencies between the database queries and transactions issued by the applications limit their efficiency .

While this restructuring does not provide performance gains by itself , the implied simplification of each database workload allows a much more efficient use of classical techniques . We illustrate the data denormalization process on three benchmark applications : TPC-W , RUBiS and RUBBoS .

JavaScript is a browser scripting language that allows developers to create sophisticated client-side interfaces for web applications .

The enormity and rapid growth of the web-graph forces quantities such as its pagerank tobe computed under missing information consisting of outlinks of pages that have not yet been crawled .

Thefirst couple of questions are addressed on the basis of certain simple bounds relating the expected distance between the true and computed pageranks and the size of the missing data . The third question is explored by devising algorithms to predict the pageranks when full information is not available .

An unsupervised clustering of the webpages on a website is a primary requirement for most wrapper induction and automated data extraction methods . Since page content can vary drastically across pages of one cluster ( e.g. , all product pages on amazon.com ) , traditional clustering methods typically use some distance function between the DOM trees representing a pair of webpages . However , without knowing which portions of the DOM tree are `` important , '' such distance functions might discriminate between similar pages based on trivial features ( e.g. , differing number of reviews on two product pages ) , or club together distinct types of pages based on superficial features present in the DOM trees of both ( e.g. , matching footer\\/copyright ) , leading to poor clustering performance . We propose using search logs to automatically find paths in the DOM trees that mark out important portions of pages , e.g. , the product title in a product page . Such paths are identified via a global analysis of the entire website , whereby search data for popular pages can be used to infer good paths even for other pages that receive little or no search traffic . The webpages on the website are then clustered using these `` key '' paths . Our algorithm only requires information on search queries , and the webpages clicked in response to them ; there is no need for human input , and it does not need to be told which portion of a webpage the user found interesting . The resulting clusterings achieve an adjusted RAND score of over 0.9 on half of the websites ( a score of 1 indicating a perfect clustering ) , and 59 % better scores on average than competing algorithms . Besides leading to refined clusterings , these key paths can be useful in the wrapper induction process itself , as shown by the high degree of match between the key paths and the manually identified paths used in existing wrappers for these sites ( 90 % average precision ) .", "81589": "An efficient and systematic method to generate xslt stylesheets for different wireless pervasive devices . It is a tedious and cumbersome process to update directly a WML document for the wireless Web because its content composes of both data and presentation .

Transferring knowledge from one domain to another is challenging due to a number of reasons . Since both conditional and marginal distribution of the training data and test data are non-identical , model trained in one domain , when directly applied to a different domain , is usually low in accuracy . For many applications with large feature sets , such as text document , sequence data , medical data , image data of different resolutions , etc. two domains usually do not contain exactly the same features , thus introducing large numbers of `` missing values '' when considered over the union of features from both domains . In other words , its marginal distributions are at most overlapping . In the same time , these problems are usually high dimensional , such as , several thousands of features . Thus , the combination of high dimensionality and missing values make the relationship in conditional probabilities between two domains hard to measure and model . To address these challenges , we propose a framework that first brings the marginal distributions of two domains closer by `` filling up '' those missing values of disjoint features . Afterwards , it looks for those comparable sub-structures in the `` latent-space '' as mapped from the expanded feature vector , where both marginal and conditional distribution are similar . With these sub-structures in latent space , the proposed approach then find common concepts that are transferable across domains with high probability . During prediction , unlabeled instances are treated as `` queries '' , the mostly related labeled instances from out-domain are retrieved , and the classification is made by weighted voting using retrieved out-domain examples . We formally show that importing feature values across domains and latent semantic index can jointly make the distributions of two related domains easier to measure than in original feature space , the nearest neighbor method employed to retrieve related out domain examples is bounded in error when predicting in-domain examples .

Wireless access with mobile ( or handheld ) devices is a promising addition to the WWW and traditional electronic business .

While the idea that querying mechanisms for complex relationships ( otherwise known as Semantic Associations ) should be integral to Semantic Web search technologies has recently gained some ground , the issue of how search results will be ranked remains largely unaddressed . Since it is expected that the number of relationships between entities in a knowledge base will be much larger than the number of entities themselves , the likelihood that Semantic Association searches would result in an overwhelming number of results for users is increased , therefore elevating the need for appropriate ranking schemes . Furthermore , it is unlikely that ranking schemes for ranking entities ( documents , resources , etc. ) may be applied to complex structures such as Semantic Associations . In this paper , we present an approach that ranks results based on how predictable a result might be for users . It is based on a relevance model SemRank , which is a rich blend of semantic and information-theoretic techniques with heuristics that supports the novel idea of modulative searches , where users may vary their search modes to effect changes in the ordering of results depending on their need .

Continuous queries are queries for which responses given to users must be continuously updated , as the sources of interest get updated . Such queries occur , for instance , during on-line decision making , e.g. , traffic flow control , weather monitoring , etc. . The problem of keeping the responses current reduces to the problem of deciding how often to visit a source to determine if and how it has been modified , in order to update earlier responses accordingly . On the surface , this seems to be similar to the crawling problem since crawlers attempt to keep indexes up-to-date as pages change and users pose search queries . We show that this is not the case , both due to the inherent differences between the nature of the two problems as well as the performance metric . We propose , develop and evaluate a novel multi-phase ( Continuous Adaptive Monitoring ) ( CAM ) solution to the problem of maintaining the currency of query results . Some of the important phases are : The tracking phase , in which changes , to an initially identified set of relevant pages , are tracked . From the observed change characteristics of these pages , a probabilistic model of their change behavior is formulated and weights are assigned to pages to denote their importance for the current queries . During the next phase , the resource allocation phase , based on these statistics , resources , needed to continuously monitor these pages for changes , are allocated . Given these resource allocations , the scheduling phase produces an optimal achievable schedule for the monitoring tasks . An experimental evaluation of our approach compared to prior approaches for crawling dynamic web pages shows the effectiveness of CAM for monitoring dynamic changes . For example , by monitoring just 5 % of the page changes , CAM is able to return 90 % of the changed information to the users . The experiments also produce some interesting observations pertaining to the differences between the two problems of crawling -- to build an index -- and the problem of change tracking -- to respond to continuous queries .", "8644808": "Geospatial mapping and navigation of the web .", "4339859": "A decentralized CF approach based on cooperative agents .

The most popular reporting statistics are the click-through rate and the conversion rate .

Specifically , our goal is to examine the content short URLs point to , how they are published , their popularity and activity over time , as well as their potential impact on the performance of the web . Our study is based on traces of short URLs as seen from two different perspectives : i ) collected through a large-scale crawl of URL shortening services , and ii ) collected by crawling Twitter messages . The former provides a general characterization on the usage of short URLs , while the latter provides a more focused view on how certain communities use shortening services . Our analysis highlights that domain and website popularity , as seen from short URLs , significantly differs from the distributions provided by well publicised services such as Alexa . The set of most popular websites pointed to by short URLs appears stable over time , despite the fact that short URLs have a limited high popularity lifetime . Surprisingly short URLs are not ephemeral , as a significant fraction , roughly 50 % , appears active for more than three months .

We consider the problem of online keyword advertising auctions among multiple bidders with limited budgets , and study a natural bidding heuristic in which advertisers attempt to optimize their utility by equalizing their return-on-investment across all keywords . We show that existing auction mechanisms combined with this heuristic can experience cycling ( as has been observed in many current systems ) , and therefore propose a modified class of mechanisms with small random perturbations . This perturbation is reminiscent of the small time-dependent perturbations employed in the dynamical systems literature to convert many types of chaos into attracting motions . We show that the perturbed mechanism provably converges in the case of first-price auctions and experimentally converges in the case of second-price auctions . Moreover , the point of convergence has a natural economic interpretation as the unique market equilibrium in the case of first-price mechanisms . In the case of second-price auctions , we conjecture that it converges to the `` supply-aware '' market equilibrium . Thus , our results can be alternatively described as a t\u00e2tonnement process for convergence to market equilibriumin which prices are adjusted on the side of the buyers rather than the sellers .

We test a set of network-based ranking algorithms , including PageRank and HITS , on this large size social network in order to identify users with high expertise . We then use simulations to identify a small number of simple simulation rules governing the question-answer dynamic in the network . These simple rules not only replicate the structural characteristics and algorithm performance on the empirically observed Java Forum , but also allow us to evaluate how other algorithms may perform in communities with different characteristics . We believe this approach will be fruitful for practical algorithm design and implementation for online expertise-sharing communities .", "310161": "A service creation environment based on end to end composition of Web services . The demand for quickly delivering new applications is increasingly becoming a business imperative today . Application development is often done in an ad hoc manner , without standard frameworks or libraries , thus resulting in poor reuse of software assets . Web services have received much interest in industry due to their potential in facilitating seamless business-to-business or enterprise application integration . A web services composition tool can help automate the process , from creating business process functionality , to developing executable workflows , to deploying them on an execution environment . However , we find that the main approaches taken thus far to standardize and compose web services are piecemeal and insufficient . The business world has adopted a ( distributed ) programming approach in which web service instances are described using WSDL , composed into flows with a language like BPEL and invoked with the SOAP protocol . Academia has propounded the AI approach of formally representing web service capabilities in ontologies , and reasoning about their composition using goal-oriented inferencing techniques from planning . We present the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the above approaches . We describe a prototype service creation environment along with a use-case scenario , and demonstrate how it can significantly speed up the time-to-market for new services .", "618523": "Dynamic maintenance of web indexes using landmarks . Recent work on incremental crawling has enabled the indexed document collection of a search engine to be more synchronized with the changing World Wide Web . However , this synchronized collection is not immediately searchable , because the keyword index is rebuilt from scratch less frequently than the collection can be refreshed . An inverted index is usually used to index documents crawled from the web . Complete index rebuild at high frequency is expensive . Previous work on incremental inverted index updates have been restricted to adding and removing documents . Updating the inverted index for previously indexed documents that have changed has not been addressed . In this paper , we propose an efficient method to update the inverted index for previously indexed documents whose contents have changed . Our method uses the idea of landmarks together with the diff algorithm to significantly reduce the number of postings in the inverted index that need to be updated . Our experiments verify that our landmark-diff method results in significant savings in the number of update operations on the inverted index .", "4629499": "A management and performance framework for semantic web servers .

This study is the first to evaluate the performance benefits of using the recently proposed TCP Splice kernel service in Web proxy servers . Previous studies show that splicing client and server TCP connections in the IP layer improves the throughput of proxy servers like firewalls and content routers by reducing the data transfer overheads . In a Web proxy server , data transfer overheads represent a relatively large fraction of the request processing overheads , in particular when content is not cacheable or the proxy cache is memory-based . The study is conducted with a socket-level implementation of TCP Splice . Compared to IP-level implementations , socket-level implementations make possible the splicing of connections with different TCP characteristics , and improve response times by reducing recovery delay after a packet loss . The experimental evaluation is focused on HTTP request types for which the proxy can fully exploit the TCP Splice service , which are the requests for non-cacheabl . content and SSL tunneling . The experimental testbed includes an emulated WAN environment and benchmark applications for HTTP\\/1 .0 Web client , Web server , and Web proxy running on AIX RS\\/6000 machines . Our experiments demonstrate that TCP Splice enables reductions in CPU utilization of 10-43 % of the CPU , depending on file sizes and request rates . Larger relative reductions are observed when tunneling SSL connections , in particular for small file transfers .

Cloud computing is the latest computing paradigm that delivers hardware and software resources as virtualized services in which users are free from the burden of worrying about the low-level system administration details . Migrating Web applications to Cloud services and integrating Cloud services into existing computing infrastructures is non-trivial . It leads to new challenges that often require innovation of paradigms and practices at all levels : technical , cultural , legal , regulatory , and social . The key problem in mapping Web applications to virtualized Cloud services is selecting the best and compatible mix of software images ( e.g. , Web server image ) and infrastructure services to ensure that Quality of Service ( QoS ) targets of an application are achieved . The fact that , when selecting Cloud services , engineers must consider heterogeneous sets of criteria and complex dependencies between infrastructure services and software images , which are impossible to resolve manually , is a critical issue . To overcome these challenges , we present a framework ( called CloudGenius ) which automates the decision-making process based on a model and factors specifically for Web server migration to the Cloud . CloudGenius leverages a well known multi-criteria decision making technique , called Analytic Hierarchy Process , to automate the selection process based on a model , factors , and QoS parameters related to an application . An example application demonstrates the applicability of the theoretical CloudGenius approach .

To answer search queries on a social network rich with user-generated content , it is desirable to give a higher ranking to content that is closer to the individual issuing the query . Queries occur at nodes in the network , documents are also created by nodes in the same network , and the goal is to find the document that matches the query and is closest in network distance to the node issuing the query . In this paper , we present the `` Partitioned Multi-Indexing '' scheme , which provides an approximate solution to this problem . With m links in the network , after an offline ~ O ( m ) pre-processing time , our scheme allows for social index operations ( i.e. , social search queries , as well as insertion and deletion of words into and from a document at any node ) , all in time ~ O ( 1 ) . Further , our scheme can be implemented on open source distributed streaming systems such as Yahoo ! S4 or Twitter 's Storm so that every social index operation takes ~ O ( 1 ) processing time and network queries in the worst case , and just two network queries in the common case where the reverse index corresponding to the query keyword is much smaller than the memory available at any distributed compute node . Building on Das Sarma et al. 's approximate distance oracle , the worst-case approximation ratio of our scheme is ~ O ( 1 ) for undirected networks . Our simulations on the social network Twitter as well as synthetic networks show that in practice , the approximation ratio is actually close to 1 for both directed and undirected networks .

Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm which allows the on-demand delivering of software , hardware , and data as services . As cloud-based services are more numerous and dynamic , the development of efficient service provisioning policies become increasingly challenging . Game theoretic approaches have shown to gain a thorough analytical understanding of the service provisioning problem . In this paper we take the perspective of Software as a Service ( SaaS ) providers which host their applications at an Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) provider . Each SaaS needs to comply with quality of service requirements , specified in Service Level Agreement ( SLA ) contracts with the end-users , which determine the revenues and penalties on the basis of the achieved performance level . SaaS providers want to maximize their revenues from SLAs , while minimizing the cost of use of resources supplied by the IaaS provider . Moreover , SaaS providers compete and bid for the use of infrastructural resources . On the other hand , the IaaS wants to maximize the revenues obtained providing virtualized resources . In this paper we model the service provisioning problem as a Generalized Nash game , and we propose an efficient algorithm for the run time management and allocation of IaaS resources to competing SaaSs .", "4284206": "Preference-based selection of highly configurable web services . A key challenge for dynamic Web service selection is that Web services are typically highly configurable and service requesters often have dynamic preferences on service configurations .

We model Web service configurations and associated prices and preferences more compactly using utility function policies , which also allows us to draw from multi-attribute decision theory methods to develop an algorithm for optimal service selection . In this paper , we present an OWL ontology for the specification of configurable Web service offers and requests , and a flexible and extensible framework for optimal service selection that combines declarative logic-based matching rules with optimization methods , such as linear programming .

Existing Web browsers handle security errors in a manner that often confuses users . In particular , when a user visits a secure site whose certificate the browser can not verify , the browser typically allows the user to view and install the certificate and connect to the site despite the verification failure . However , few users understand the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks and the principles behind certificate-based authentication . We propose context-sensitive certificate verification ( CSCV ) , whereby the browser interrogates the user about the context in which a certificate verification error occurs . Considering the context , the browser then guides the user in handling and possibly overcoming the security error . We also propose specific password warnings ( SPW ) when users are about to send passwords in a form vulnerable to eavesdropping . We performed user studies to evaluate CSCV and SPW . Our results suggest that CSCV and SPW can greatly improve Web browsing security and are easy to use even without training .

In today 's Web , many functionality-wise similar Web services are offered through heterogeneous interfaces ( operation definitions ) and business protocols ( ordering constraints defined on legal operation invocation sequences ) .

There have been approaches for classifying possible mismatches between service interfaces and business protocols to facilitate adapter development . However , the hard job is that of identifying , given two service specifications , the actual mismatches between their interfaces and business protocols .

To process the intent of a request , assistants read the request and then locate , complete , and submit a form that corresponds to the expressed intent . Automatically or semi-automatically processing the intent expressed in a request on behalf of an assistant would ease the mundane and repetitive nature of this kind of work .

Web service composition provides a means of customized and flexible integration of service functionalities . Quality-of-Service ( QoS ) optimization algorithms select services in order to adapt workflows to the non-functional requirements of the user . With increasing number of services in a workflow , previous approaches fail to achieve a sufficient reliability . Moreover , expensive ad-hoc replanning is required to deal with service failures . The major problem with such sequential application of planning and replanning is that it ignores the potential costs during the initial planning and they consequently are hidden from the decision maker . Our basic idea to overcome this substantial problem is to compute a QoS optimized selection of service clusters that includes a sufficient number of backup services for each service employed . To support the human decision maker in the service selection task , our approach considers the possible repair costs directly in the initial composition . On the basis of a multi-objective approach and using a suitable service selection interface , the decision maker can select compositions in line with his\\/her personal risk preferences .", "3598007": "A community-aware search engine .

Social hierarchy and stratification among humans is a well studied concept in sociology . The popularity of online social networks presents an opportunity to study social hierarchy for different types of networks and at different scales . We adopt the premise that people form connections in a social network based on their perceived social hierarchy ; as a result , the edge directions in directed social networks can be leveraged to infer hierarchy . In this paper , we define a measure of hierarchy in a directed online social network , and present an efficient algorithm to compute this measure . We validate our measure using ground truth including Wikipedia notability score . We use this measure to study hierarchy in several directed online social networks including Twitter , Delicious , YouTube , Flickr , LiveJournal , and curated lists of several categories of people based on different occupations , and different organizations . Our experiments on different online social networks show how hierarchy emerges as we increase the size of the network . This is in contrast to random graphs , where the hierarchy decreases as the network size increases . Further , we show that the degree of stratification in a network increases very slowly as we increase the size of the graph .", "13512950": "Adaptive bidding for display advertising . Motivated by the emergence of auction-based marketplaces for display ads such as the Right Media Exchange , we study the design of a bidding agent that implements a display advertising campaign by bidding in such a marketplace . The bidding agent must acquire a given number of impressions with a given target spend , when the highest external bid in the marketplace is drawn from an unknown distribution P. The quantity and spend constraints arise from the fact that display ads are usually sold on a CPM basis . We consider both the full information setting , where the winning price in each auction is announced publicly , and the partially observable setting where only the winner obtains information about the distribution ; these differ in the penalty incurred by the agent while attempting to learn the distribution . We provide algorithms for both settings , and prove performance guarantees using bounds on uniform closeness from statistics , and techniques from online learning . We experimentally evaluate these algorithms : both algorithms perform very well with respect to both target quantity and spend ; further , our algorithm for the partially observable case performs nearly as well as that for the fully observable setting despite the higher penalty incurred during learning .", "11841922": "Optimal rare query suggestion with implicit user feedback . Query suggestion has been an effective approach to help users narrow down to the information they need . However , most of existing studies focused on only popular\\/head queries . Since rare queries possess much less information ( e.g. , clicks ) than popular queries in the query logs , it is much more difficult to efficiently suggest relevant queries to a rare query . In this paper , we propose an optimal rare query suggestion framework by leveraging implicit feedbacks from users in the query logs . Our model resembles the principle of pseudo-relevance feedback which assumes that top-returned results by search engines are relevant . However , we argue that the clicked URLs and skipped URLs contain different levels of information and thus should be treated differently . Hence , our framework optimally combines both the click and skip information from users and uses a random walk model to optimize the query correlation . Our model specifically optimizes two parameters : ( 1 ) the restarting ( jumping ) rate of random walk , and ( 2 ) the combination ratio of click and skip information . Unlike the Rocchio algorithm , our learning process does not involve the content of the URLs but simply leverages the click and skip counts in the query-URL bipartite graphs . Consequently , our model is capable of scaling up to the need of commercial search engines . Experimental results on one-month query logs from a large commercial search engine with over 40 million rare queries demonstrate the superiority of our framework , with statistical significance , over the traditional random walk models and pseudo-relevance feedback models .", "11850677": "Learning to re-rank : query-dependent image re-ranking using click data . Our objective is to improve the performance of keyword based image search engines by re-ranking their original results . To this end , we address three limitations of existing search engines in this paper . First , there is no straight-forward , fully automated way of going from textual queries to visual features . Image search engines therefore primarily rely on static and textual features for ranking . Visual features are mainly used for secondary tasks such as finding similar images . Second , image rankers are trained on query-image pairs labeled with relevance judgments determined by human experts . Such labels are well known to be noisy due to various factors including ambiguous queries , unknown user intent and subjectivity in human judgments . This leads to learning a sub-optimal ranker . Finally , a static ranker is typically built to handle disparate user queries . The ranker is therefore unable to adapt its parameters to suit the query at hand which again leads to sub-optimal results . We demonstrate that all of these problems can be mitigated by employing a re-ranking algorithm that leverages aggregate user click data . We hypothesize that images clicked in response to a query are mostly relevant to the query . We therefore re-rank the original search results so as to promote images that are likely to be clicked to the top of the ranked list . Our re-ranking algorithm employs Gaussian Process regression to predict the normalized click count for each image , and combines it with the original ranking score . Our approach is shown to significantly boost the performance of the Bing image search engine on a wide range of tail queries .", "91646": "A system for principled matchmaking in an electronic marketplace .

The majority of people in rural developing regions do not have access to the World Wide Web . Traditional network connectivity technologies have proven to be prohibitively expensive in these areas . The emergence of new long-range wireless technologies provide hope for connecting these rural regions to the Internet . However , the network connectivity provided by these new solutions are by nature intermittent due to high network usage rates , frequent power-cuts and the use of delay tolerant links . Typical applications , especially interactive applications like web search , do not tolerate intermittent connectivity . In this paper , we present the design and implementation of RuralCafe , a system intended to support efficient web search over intermittent networks . RuralCafe enables users to perform web search asynchronously and find what they are looking for in one round of intermittency as opposed to multiple rounds of search\\/downloads . RuralCafe does this by providing an expanded search query interface which allows a user to specify additional query terms to maximize the utility of the results returned by a search query . Given knowledge of the limited available network resources , RuralCafe performs optimizations to prefetch pages to best satisfy a search query based on a user 's search preferences . In addition , RuralCafe does not require modifications to the web browser , and can provide single round search results tailored to various types of networks and economic constraints .

We name the protocol HTTPi and give it an efficient design that is easy to deploy for today 's web . In particular , we tackle several previously-unidentified challenges , such as supporting progressive page loading on the client 's browser , handling mixed content , and defining access control policies among HTTP , HTTPi , and HTTPS content from the same domain . Our prototyping and evaluation experience show that HTTPi incurs negligible performance overhead over HTTP , can leverage existing web infrastructure such as CDNs or caching proxies without any modifications to them , and can make many of the mixed-content problems in existing HTTPS web sites easily go away .

The Generalized Second Price ( GSP ) auction is the primary auction used for selling sponsored search advertisements . In this paper we consider the revenue of this auction at equilibrium . We prove that if agent values are drawn from identical regular distributions , then the GSP auction paired with an appropriate reserve price generates a constant fraction ( 1\\/6th ) of the optimal revenue . In the full-information game , we show that at any Nash equilibrium of the GSP auction obtains at least half of the revenue of the VCG mechanism excluding the payment of a single participant . This bound holds also with any reserve price , and is tight . Finally , we consider the tradeoff between maximizing revenue and social welfare . We introduce a natural convexity assumption on the click-through rates and show that it implies that the revenue-maximizing equilibrium of GSP in the full information model will necessarily be envy-free . In particular , it is always possible to maximize revenue and social welfare simultaneously when click-through rates are convex . Without this convexity assumption , however , we demonstrate that revenue may be maximized at a non-envy-free equilibrium that generates a socially inefficient allocation .", "5343699": "Shared lexicon for distributed annotations on the Web .

Users of social networking services can connect with each other by forming communities for online interaction . Yet as the number of communities hosted by such websites grows over time , users have even greater need for effective community recommendations in order to meet more users . In this paper , we investigate two algorithms from very different domains and evaluate their effectiveness for personalized community recommendation . First is association rule mining ( ARM ) , which discovers associations between sets of communities that are shared across many users . Second is latent Dirichlet allocation ( LDA ) , which models user-community co-occurrences using latent aspects . In comparing LDA with ARM , we are interested in discovering whether modeling low-rank latent structure is more effective for recommendations than directly mining rules from the observed data . We experiment on an Orkut data set consisting of 492,104 users and 118,002 communities . Our empirical comparisons using the top-k recommendations metric show that LDA performs consistently better than ARM for the community recommendation task when recommending a list of 4 or more communities . However , for recommendation lists of up to 3 communities , ARM is still a bit better . We analyze examples of the latent information learned by LDA to explain this finding .

Web search is probably the single most important application on the Internet . The most famous search techniques are perhaps the PageRank and HITS algorithms .

They exploit this social phenomenon to identify quality pages , e.g. , `` authority '' pages and `` hub '' pages . In this paper we argue that these algorithms miss an important dimension of the Web , the temporal dimension . The Web is not a static environment . It changes constantly .

When the real-world entity evolves over time , the noisy sources can delay , or even miss , reporting some of the real-world updates . This temporal aspect introduces two key challenges for consensus-based approaches : ( i ) due to delays , the mapping between a source 's noisy observation and the real-world update it observes is unknown , and ( ii ) missed updates may translate to missing values for the consensus problem , even if the mapping is known . To overcome these challenges , we propose a formal approach that models the history of updates of the real-world entity as a hidden semi-Markovian process ( HSMM ) .

We propose algorithms based on Gibbs Sampling and EM to jointly infer both the history of real-world updates as well as the unknown mapping between them and the source values . We demonstrate using experiments on real-world datasets how our history-based techniques improve upon history-agnostic consensus-based approaches .", "4648304": "Topic-oriented query expansion for web search .

We introduce the concept of a vertex collocation profile ( VCP ) for the purpose of topological link analysis and prediction .

The VCP approach offers a new tool for domain experts to understand the underlying growth mechanisms in their networks and to analyze link formation mechanisms in the appropriate sociological , biological , physical , or other context . The same resolution that gives VCP its analytical power also enables it to perform well when used in supervised models to discriminate potential new links . We first develop the theory , mathematics , and algorithms underlying VCPs . Then we demonstrate VCP methods performing link prediction competitively with unsupervised and supervised methods across several different network families . We conclude with timing results that introduce the comparative performance of several existing algorithms and the practicability of VCP computations on large networks .", "681261": "Fine grained content-based adaptation mechanism for providing high end-user quality of experience with adaptive hypermedia systems . New communication technologies can enable Web users to access personalised information `` anytime , anywhere\u00f6 . However , the network environments allowing this `` anytime , anywhere\u00f6 access may have widely varying performance characteristics such as bandwidth , level of congestion , mobility support , and cost of transmission . It is unrealistic to expect that the quality of delivery of the same content can be maintained in this variable environment , but rather an effort must be made to fit the content served to the current delivery conditions , thus ensuring high Quality of Experience ( QoE ) to the users . This paper introduces an end-user QoE-aware adaptive hypermedia framework that extends the adaptation functionality of adaptive hypermedia systems with a fine-grained content-based adaptation mechanism . The proposed mechanism attempts to take into account multiple factors affecting QoE in relation to the delivery of Web content . Various simulation tests investigate the performance improvements provided by this mechanism , in a home-like , low bit rate operational environment , in terms of access time per page , aggregate access time per browsing session and quantity of transmitted information .", "735741": "WEBCAP : a capacity planning tool for web resource management .

In sponsored search , a number of advertising slots is available on a search results page , and have to be allocated among a set of advertisers competing to display an ad on the page .

User-Interactive Question Answering ( QA ) communities such as Yahoo ! Answers are growing in popularity . However , as these QA sites always have thousands of new questions posted daily , it is difficult for users to find the questions that are of interest to them . Consequently , this may delay the answering of the new questions . This gives rise to question recommendation techniques that help users locate interesting questions .

We present a technique for automatically evaluating strategies using Web hierarchies , such as Open Directory , in place of user feedback . We apply this evaluation methodology to a mix of document representation strategies , including the use of text , anchor-text , and links .

Social tagging provides valuable and crucial information for large-scale web image retrieval . It is ontology-free and easy to obtain ; however , irrelevant tags frequently appear , and users typically will not tag all semantic objects in the image , which is also called semantic loss . To avoid noises and compensate for the semantic loss , tag recommendation is proposed in literature . However , current recommendation simply ranks the related tags based on the single modality of tag co-occurrence on the whole dataset , which ignores other modalities , such as visual correlation . This paper proposes a multi-modality recommendation based on both tag and visual correlation , and formulates the tag recommendation as a learning problem . Each modality is used to generate a ranking feature , and Rankboost algorithm is applied to learn an optimal combination of these ranking features from different modalities .

Web applications are becoming increasingly popular for mobile wireless systems . However , wireless networks can have high packet loss rates , which can degrade web browsing performance on wireless systems . An alternative approach is wireless thin-client computing , in which the web browser runs on a remote thin server with a more reliable wired connection to the Internet . A mobile client then maintains a connection to the thin server to receive display updates over the lossy wireless network . To assess the viability of this thin-client approach , we compare the web browsing performance of thin clients against fat clients that run the web browser locally in lossy wireless networks . Our results show that thin clients can operate quite effectively over lossy networks . Compared to fat clients running web browsers locally , our results show surprisingly that thin clients can be faster and more resilient on web applications over lossy wireless LANs despite having to send more data over the network . We characterize and analyze different design choices in various thin-client systems and explain why these approaches can yield superior web browsing performance in lossy wireless networks .", "8950514": "XSLT by example .

Web search queries are an encoding of the user 's search intent and extracting structured information from them can facilitate central search engine operations like improving the ranking of search results and advertisements . Not surprisingly , this area has attracted a lot of attention in the research community in the last few years . The problem is , however , made challenging by the fact that search queries tend to be extremely succinct ; a condensation of user search needs to the bare-minimum set of keywords . In this paper we consider the problem of extracting , with no manual intervention , the hidden structure behind the observed search queries in a domain : the origins of the constituent keywords as well as the manner the individual keywords are assembled together . We formalize important properties of the problem and then give a principled solution based on generative models that satisfies these properties . Using manually labeled data we show that the query templates extracted by our solution are superior to those discovered by strong baseline methods . The query templates extracted by our approach have potential uses in many search engine tasks ; query answering , advertisement matching and targeting , to name a few .

Continuous queries are used to monitor changes to time varying data and to provide results useful for online decision making . Typically a user desires to obtain the value of some function over distributed data items , for example , to determine when and whether ( a ) the traffic entering a highway from multiple feed roads will result in congestion in a thoroughfare or ( b ) the value of a stock portfolio exceeds a threshold . Using the standard Web infrastructure for these applications will increase the reach of the underlying information . But , since these queries involve data from multiple sources , with sources supporting standard HTTP ( pull-based ) interfaces , special query processing techniques are needed . Also , these applications often have the flexibility to tolerate some incoherency , i.e. , some differences between the results reported to the user and that produced from the virtual database made up of the distributed data sources . In this paper , we develop and evaluate client-pull-based techniques for refreshing data so that the results of the queries over distributed data can be correctly reported , conforming to the limited incoherency acceptable to the users . We model as well as estimate the dynamics of the data items using a probabilistic approach based on Markov Chains . Depending on the dynamics of data we adapt the data refresh times to deliver query results with the desired coherency . The commonality of data needs of multiple queries is exploited to further reduce refresh overheads . Effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using live sources of dynamic data : the number of refreshes it requires is ( a ) an order of magnitude less than what we would need if every potential update is pulled from the sources , and ( b ) comparable to the number of messages needed by an ideal algorithm , one that knows how to optimally refresh the data from distributed data sources .

We abstract and study the complexity of the { \\ em bid optimization problem } which is to determine an advertiser 's bids on a subset of keywords ( possibly using broad match ) so that her profit is maximized . In the query language model when the advertiser is allowed to bid on all queries as broad match , we present a linear programming ( LP ) - based polynomial-time algorithm that gets the optimal profit .

Online collaboration and sharing is the central theme of many web-based services that create the so-called Web 2.0 phenomena .

However , in the age of Web 2.0 , where every user is also a writer and publisher , the deployment of mirror sites makes consistency maintenance a Web scale problem . Traditional concurrency control methods ( e.g. two phase lock , serialization , etc. ) are not up to the task for several reasons . First , large network latency between mirror sites will make two phase locking a throughput bottleneck . Second , locking will block a large portion of concurrent operations , which makes it impossible to provide large-scale availability . On the other hand , most Web 2.0 operations do not need strict serializability - it is not the intention of a user who is correcting a typo in a shared document to block another who is adding a comment , as long as consistency can still be achieved .

To address this deficiency , we developed Subspace , a cross-domain communication mechanism that allows efficient communication across domains without sacrificing security . Our prototype requires only a small JavaScript library , and works across all major browsers . We believe Subspace can serve as a new secure communication primitive for web mashups .", "6576780": "Analysis of topological characteristics of huge online social networking services . Social networking services are a fast-growing business in the Internet . However , it is unknown if online relationships and their growth patterns are the same as in real-life social networks . In this paper , we compare the structures of three online social networking services : Cyworld , MySpace , and orkut , each with more than 10 million users , respectively . We have access to complete data of Cyworld 's ilchon ( friend ) relationships and analyze its degree distribution , clustering property , degree correlation , and evolution over time . We also use Cyworld data to evaluate the validity of snowball sampling method , which we use to crawl and obtain partial network topologies of MySpace and orkut . Cyworld , the oldest of the three , demonstrates a changing scaling behavior over time in degree distribution . The latest Cyworld data 's degree distribution exhibits a multi-scaling behavior , while those of MySpace and orkut have simple scaling behaviors with different exponents . Very interestingly , each of the two e ponents corresponds to the different segments in Cyworld 's degree distribution . Certain online social networking services encourage online activities that can not be easily copied in real life ; we show that they deviate from close-knit online social networks which show a similar degree correlation pattern to real-life social networks .", "10460575": "Constructing travel itineraries from tagged geo-temporal breadcrumbs .

Web performance measurements and availability tests have been carried out using a variety of infrastructures over the last several years . Disruptions in the Internet can lead to Web sites being unavailable or increase user-perceived latency . The unavailability could be due to DNS , failures in segments of the physical network cutting off thousands of users , or attacks . Prompt reactions to network-wide events can be facilitated by local or remote measurement and monitoring . Better yet , a distributed set of intercommunicating measurement and monitoring entities that react to events dynamically could go a long way to handle disruptions . We have designed and built ATMEN , a triggered measurement infrastructure to communicate and coordinate across various administrative entities . ATMEN nodes can trigger new measurements , query ongoing passive measurements or historical measurements stored on remote nodes , and coordinate the responses to make local decisions . ATMEN reduces wasted measurements by judiciously reusing measurements along three axes : spatial , temporal , and application . We describe the use of ATMEN for key Web applications such as performance based ranking of popular Web sites and availability of DNS servers on which most Web transactions are dependent . The evaluation of ATMEN is done using multiple network monitoring entities called Gigascopes installed across the USA , measurement data of a popular network application involving millions of users distributed across the Internet , and scores of clients to aid in gathering measurement information upon demand .

The run-time binding of web services has been recently put forward in order to support rapid and dynamic web service compositions .

Although very efficient , local selection strategy fails short in handling global QoS requirements . Solutions based on global optimization , on the other hand , can handle global constraints , but their poor performance renders them inappropriate for applications with dynamic and real-time requirements . In this paper we address this problem and propose a solution that combines global optimization with local selection techniques to benefit from the advantages of both worlds . The proposed solution consists of two steps : first , we use mixed integer programming ( MIP ) to find the optimal decomposition of global QoS constraints into local constraints .

Recent observations through experiments that we have performed incurrent third generation wireless networks have revealed that the achieved throughput over wireless links varies widely depending on the application . In particular , the throughput achieved by file transfer application ( FTP ) and web browsing application ( HTTP ) are quite different . The throughput achieved over a HTTP session is much lower than that achieved over an FTP session . The reason for the lower HTTP throughput is that the HTTP protocol is affected by the large Round-Trip Time ( RTT ) across Wireless links . HTTP transfers require multiple TCP connections and DNS lookups before a HTTP page can be displayed . Each TCP connection requires several RTTs to fully open the TCP send window and each DNS lookup requires several RTTs before resolving the domain name to IP mapping . These TCP\\/DNS RTTs significantly degrade the performance of HTTP over wireless links . To overcome these problems , we have developed session level optimization techniques to enhance HTTP download mechanisms . These techniques ( a ) minimize the number of DNS lookups over the wireless link and ( b ) minimize the number of TCP connections opened by the browser . These optimizations bridge the mismatch caused by wireless links between application-level protocols ( such as HTTP ) and transport-level protocols ( such asTCP ) . Our solutions do not require any client-side software and can be deployed transparently on a service provider network toprovide 30-50 % decrease in end-to-end user perceived latency and 50-100 % increase in data throughput across wireless links for HTTP sessions .", "4337520": "Answering relationship queries on the web . Finding relationships between entities on the Web , e.g. , the connections between different places or the commonalities of people , is a novel and challenging problem . Existing Web search engines excel in keyword matching and document ranking , but they can not well handle many relationship queries . This paper proposes a new method for answering relationship queries on two entities . Our method first respectively retrieves the top Web pages for either entity from a Web search engine . It then matches these Web pages and generates an ordered list of Web page pairs . Each Web page pair consists of one Web page for either entity . The top ranked Web page pairs are likely to contain the relationships between the two entities . One main challenge in the ranking process is to effectively filter out the large amount of noise in the Web pages without losing much useful information . To achieve this , our method assigns appropriate weights to terms in Web pages and intelligently identifies the potential connecting terms that capture the relationships between the two entities . Only those top potential connecting terms with large weights are used to rank Web page pairs . Finally , the top ranked Web page pairs are presented to the searcher . For each such pair , the query terms and the top potential connecting terms are properly highlighted so that the relationships between the two entities can be easily identified . We implemented a prototype on top of the Google search engine and evaluated it under a wide variety of query scenarios .

In this paper , we study the problem of transfer learning from text to images in the context of network data in which link based bridges are available to transfer the knowledge between the different domains . The problem of classification of image data is often much more challenging than text data because of the following two reasons : ( a ) Labeled text data is very widely available for classification purposes . On the other hand , this is often not the case for image data , in which a lot of images are available from many sources , but many of them are often not labeled . ( b ) The image features are not directly related to semantic concepts inherent in class labels . On the other hand , since text data tends to have natural semantic interpretability ( because of their human origins ) , they are often more directly related to class labels . Therefore , the relationships between the images and text features also provide additional hints for the classification process in terms of the image feature transformations which provide the most effective results . The semantic challenges of image features are glaringly evident , when we attempt to recognize complex abstract concepts , and the visual features often fail to discriminate such concepts . However , the copious availability of bridging relationships between text and images in the context of web and social network data can be used in order to design for effective classifiers for image data . One of our goals in this paper is to develop a mathematical model for the functional relationships between text and image features , so as indirectly transfer semantic knowledge through feature transformations . This feature transformation is accomplished by mapping instances from different domains into a common space of unspecific topics . This is used as a bridge to semantically connect the two heterogeneous spaces . This is also helpful for the cases where little image data is available for the classification process . We evaluate our knowledge transfer techniques on an image classification task with labeled text corpora and show the effectiveness with respect to competing algorithms .", "13185533": "Generalized fact-finding . Once information retrieval has located a document , and information extraction has provided its contents , how do we know whether we should actually believe it ?

However , as fact-finders consider only `` who claims what '' , they ignore a great deal of relevant background and contextual information . We present a framework for `` lifting '' ( generalizing ) the fact-finding process , allowing us to elegantly incorporate knowledge such as the confidence of the information extractor and the attributes of the information sources .

This paper describes a novel approach for obtaining semantic interoperability among data sources in a bottom-up , semi-automatic manner without relying on pre-existing , global semantic models . We assume that large amounts of data exist that have been organized and annotated according to local schemas . Seeing semantics as a form of agreement , our approach enables the participating data sources to incrementally develop global agreement in an evolutionary and completely decentralized process that solely relies on pair-wise , local interactions : Participants provide translations between schemas they are interested in and can learn about other translations by routing queries ( gossiping ) . To support the participants in assessing the semantic quality of the achieved agreements we develop a formal framework that takes into account both syntactic and semantic criteria . The assessment process is incremental and the quality ratings are adjusted along with the operation of the system . Ultimately , this process results in global agreement , i.e. , the semantics that all participants understand . We discuss strategies to efficiently find translations and provide results from a case study to justify our claims . Our approach applies to any system which provides a communication infrastructure ( existing websites or databases , decentralized systems , P2P systems ) and offers the opportunity to study semantic interoperability as a global phenomenon in a network of information sharing parties .", "10057110": "A client-server architecture for state-dependent dynamic visualizations on the web . As sophisticated enterprise applications move to the Web , some advanced user experiences become difficult to migrate due to prohibitively high computation , memory , and bandwidth requirements .

Dynamic resource provisioning aims at maintaining the end-to-end response time of a web application within a pre-defined SLA . Although the topic has been well studied for monolithic applications , provisioning resources for applications composed of multiple services remains a challenge . When the SLA is violated , one must decide which service ( s ) should be reprovisioned for optimal effect . We propose to assign an SLA only to the front-end service . Other services are not given any particular response time objectives . Services are autonomously responsible for their own provisioning operations and collaboratively negotiate performance objectives with each other to decide the provisioning service ( s ) .

We take advantage of application specific semantics to design distributed objects to manage a specific subset of shared information using simple and effective consistency models . Our experimental results show that by slightly relaxing consistency within individual distributed objects , we can build an edge service system that is highly available and efficient .

As the popularity of the web increases and web applications become tools of everyday use , the role of web security has been gaining importance as well . The last years have shown a significant increase in the number of web-based attacks . For example , there has been extensive press coverage of recent security incidences involving the loss of sensitive credit card information belonging to millions of customers . Many web application security vulnerabilities result from generic input validation problems . Examples of such vulnerabilities are SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting ( XSS ) . Although the majority of web vulnerabilities are easy to understand and to avoid , many web developers are , unfortunately , not security-aware . As a result , there exist many web sites on the Internet that are vulnerable . This paper demonstrates how easy it is for attackers to automatically discover and exploit application-level vulnerabilities in a large number of web applications . To this end , we developed SecuBat , a generic and modular web vulnerability scanner that , similar to a port scanner , automatically analyzes web sites with the aim of finding exploitable SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities . Using SecuBat , we were able to find many potentially vulnerable web sites .

The primary function of current Web search engines is essentially relevance ranking at the document level . However , myriad structured information about real-world objects is embedded in static Web pages and online Web databases . Document-level information retrieval can unfortunately lead to highly inaccurate relevance ranking in answering object-oriented queries . In this paper , we propose a paradigm shift to enable searching at the object level . In traditional information retrieval models , documents are taken as the retrieval units and the content of a document is considered reliable . However , this reliability assumption is no longer valid in the object retrieval context when multiple copies of information about the same object typically exist . These copies may be inconsistent because of diversity of Web site qualities and the limited performance of current information extraction techniques . If we simply combine the noisy and inaccurate attribute information extracted from different sources , we may not be able to achieve satisfactory retrieval performance . In this paper , we propose several language models for Web object retrieval , namely an unstructured object retrieval model , a structured object retrieval model , and a hybrid model with both structured and unstructured retrieval features .

Portlets strive to play at the front end the same role that Web services currently enjoy at the back end , namely , enablers of application assembly through reusable services . However , it is well-known in the component community that , the larger the component , the more reduced the reuse . Hence , the coarse-grained nature of portlets ( they encapsulate also the presentation layer ) can jeopardize this vision of portlets as reusable services . To avoid this situation , this work proposes a perspective shift in portlet development by introducing the notion of Consumer Profile . While the user profile characterizes the end user ( e.g. age , name , etc ) , the Consumer Profile captures the idiosyncrasies of the organization through which the portlet is being delivered ( e.g. the portal owner ) as far as the portlet functionality is concerned . The user profile can be dynamic and hence , requires the portlet to be customized at runtime . By contrast , the Consumer Profile is known at registration time , and it is not always appropriate\\/possible to consider it at runtime . Rather , it is better to customize the code at development time , and produce an organization-specific portlet which built-in , custom functionality . In this scenario , we no longer have a portlet but a family of portlets , and the portlet provider becomes the `` assembly line '' of this family .

Computer-aided learning is fast gaining traction in developing regions as a means to augment classroom instruction .

The interaction of children with computers is seen at various levels , from unsupervised self-guided learning at public booths without specific curriculum to highly regulated in-class computer applications with modules designed to go with school curriculum . Such learning is used at various levels from children as young as 5 year-old to high-schoolers .

We find that in such circumstances , there emerges a pattern of learning , unique to multi-user environments - wherein certain children tend to learn better because of their control of the mouse .

Our models are based on extensions to standard topic modeling methods such as LDA and PLSA to induce multi-grain topics . We argue that multi-grain models are more appropriate for our task since standard models tend to produce topics that correspond to global properties of objects ( e.g. , the brand of a product type ) rather than the aspects of an object that tend to be rated by a user . The models we present not only extract ratable aspects , but also cluster them into coherent topics , e.g. , ` waitress ' and ` bartender ' are part of the same topic ` staff ' for restaurants . This differentiates it from much of the previous work which extracts aspects through term frequency analysis with minimal clustering .

This paper proposes an active learning approach using language model statistics to detect Wikipedia vandalism . Wikipedia is a popular and influential collaborative information system . The collaborative nature of authoring , as well as the high visibility of its content , have exposed Wikipedia articles to vandalism . Vandalism is defined as malicious editing intended to compromise the integrity of the content of articles . Extensive manual efforts are being made to combat vandalism and an automated approach to alleviate the laborious process is needed . This paper builds statistical language models , constructing distributions of words from the revision history of Wikipedia articles . As vandalism often involves the use of unexpected words to draw attention , the fitness ( or lack thereof ) of a new edit when compared with language models built from previous versions may well indicate that an edit is a vandalism instance . In addition , the paper adopts an active learning model to solve the problem of noisy and incomplete labeling of Wikipedia vandalism .

The neighborhood function provides a wealth of information about the graph ( 10 ) ( e.g. , it easily allows one to compute its diameter ) , but it is very expensive to compute it exactly . Recently , the ANF algorithm ( 10 ) ( approximate neighborhood function ) has been proposed with the purpose of approximating NG ( t ) on large graphs .

Modern search engines are expected to make documents searchable shortly after they appear on the ever changing Web . To satisfy this requirement , the Web is frequently crawled . Due to the sheer size of their indexes , search engines distribute the crawled documents among thousands of servers in a scheme called local index-partitioning , such that each server indexes only several million pages . To ensure documents from the same host ( e.g. , www.nytimes.com ) are distributed uniformly over the servers , for load balancing purposes , random routing of documents to servers is common . To expedite the time documents become searchable after being crawled , documents may be simply appended to the existing index partitions . However , indexing by merely appending documents , results in larger index sizes since document reordering for index compactness is no longer performed . This , in turn , degrades search query processing performance which depends heavily on index sizes . A possible way to balance quick document indexing with efficient query processing , is to deploy online document routing strategies that are designed to reduce index sizes . This work considers the effects of several online document routing strategies on the aggregated partitioned index size . We show that there exists a tradeoff between the compression of a partitioned index and the distribution of documents from the same host across the index partitions ( i.e. , host distribution ) . We suggest and evaluate several online routing strategies with regard to their compression , host distribution , and complexity . In particular , we present a term based routing algorithm which is shown analytically to provide better compression results than the industry standard random routing scheme . In addition , our algorithm demonstrates comparable compression performance and host distribution while having much better running time complexity than other document routing heuristics .

In an interactive search , the user provides feedback regarding her satisfaction with entities she visits during the travel , and the system changes the route , in real time , accordingly . The goal is to use the interaction for computing a route that is more effective than a route that is computed in a non-interactive fashion .", "4419682": "A high-performance interpretive approach to schema-directed parsing . XML delivers key advantages in interoperability due to its flexibility , expressiveness , and platform-neutrality . As XML has become a performance-critical aspect of the next generation of business computing infrastructure , however , it has become increasingly clear that XML parsing often carries a heavy performance penalty , and that current , widely-used parsing technologies are unable to meet the performance demands of an XML-based computing infrastructure . Several efforts have been made to address this performance gap through the use of grammar-based parser generation . While the performance of generated parsers has been significantly improved , adoption of the technology has been hindered by the complexity of compiling and deploying the generated parsers . Through careful analysis of the operations required for parsing and validation , we have devised a set of specialized byte codes , designed for the task of XML parsing and validation . These byte codes are designed to engender the benefits of fine-grained composition of parsing and validation that make existing compiled parsers fast , while being coarse-grained enough to minimize interpreter overhead . This technique of using an interpretive , validating parser balances the need for performance against the requirements of simple tooling and robust scalable infrastructure . Our approach is demonstrated with a specialized schema compiler , used to generate byte codes which in turn drive an interpretive parser . With almost as little tooling and deployment complexity as a traditional interpretive parser , the byte code-driven parser usually demonstrates performance within 20 % of the fastest fully compiled solutions .", "9067385": "Parallel crawlers .

We present a probabilistic model for generating personalised recommendations of items to users of a web service . The Matchbox system makes use of content information in the form of user and item meta data in combination with collaborative filtering information from previous user behavior in order to predict the value of an item for a user . Users and items are represented by feature vectors which are mapped into a low-dimensional ` trait space ' in which similarity is measured in terms of inner products . The model can be trained from different types of feedback in order to learn user-item preferences . Here we present three alternatives : direct observation of an absolute rating each user gives to some items , observation of a binary preference ( like \\/ do n't like ) and observation of a set of ordinal ratings on a user-specific scale . Efficient inference is achieved by approximate message passing involving a combination of Expectation Propagation ( EP ) and Variational Message Passing . We also include a dynamics model which allows an item 's popularity , a user 's taste or a user 's personal rating scale to drift over time . By using Assumed-Density Filtering ( ADF ) for training , the model requires only a single pass through the training data . This is an on-line learning algorithm capable of incrementally taking account of new data so the system can immediately reflect the latest user preferences . We evaluate the performance of the algorithm on the MovieLens and Netflix data sets consisting of approximately 1,000,000 and 100,000,000 ratings respectively .

This leads us to the definition of ontology mapping rules by manual semantic annotation and the usage of the mapping rules and of web services for semantic queries . In order to create metadata , the framework combines the presentation layer with the data description layer -- in contrast to `` conventional '' annotation , which remains at the presentation layer . Therefore , we refer to the framework as deep annotation 1 .

We propose a novel cost-efficient approach to threshold selection for binary web-page classification problems with imbalanced class distributions .

In such problems , using uniform random sampling in constructing sample sets for threshold setting requires large sample sizes in order to include a statistically sufficient number of examples of the minority class . On the other hand , manually labeling examples is expensive and budgetary considerations require that the size of sample sets be limited . These conflicting requirements make threshold selection a challenging problem . Our method of sample-set construction is a novel approach based on stratified sampling , in which manually labeled examples are expanded to reflect the true class distribution of the web-page population . Our experimental results show that using false positive rate as the criterion for threshold setting results in lower-variance threshold estimates than using other widely used accuracy measures such as F1 and precision .", "668174": "Semantic resource management for the web : an e-learning application .

High-quality , personalized recommendations are a key feature in many online systems . Since these systems often have explicit knowledge of social network structures , the recommendations may incorporate this information .

The goal of a trust-based recommendation system is to generate personalized recommendations by aggregating the opinions of other users in the trust network . In analogy to prior work on voting and ranking systems , we use the axiomatic approach from the theory of social choice . We develop a set of five natural axioms that a trust-based recommendation system might be expected to satisfy . Then , we show that no system can simultaneously satisfy all the axioms . However , for any subset of four of the five axioms we exhibit a recommendation system that satisfies those axioms . Next we consider various ways of weakening the axioms , one of which leads to a unique recommendation system based on random walks . We consider other recommendation systems , including systems based on personalized PageRank , majority of majorities , and minimum cuts , and search for alternative axiomatizations that uniquely characterize these systems . Finally , we determine which of these systems are incentive compatible , meaning that groups of agents interested in manipulating recommendations can not induce others to share their opinion by lying about their votes or modifying their trust links .

Similar results are offered in other domains like food , entertainment , travel , etc. . All these experiences are fueled by the availability of structured data about the entities of interest . To obtain this structured data , it is necessary to solve the following problem : given a category of entities with its schema , and a set of Web pages that mention and describe entities belonging to the category , build a structured representation for the entity under the given schema . Specifically , collect structured numerical or discrete attributes of the entities . Most previous approaches regarded this as an information extraction problem on individual documents , and made no special use of numerical attributes . In contrast , we present an end-to-end framework which leverages signals not only from the Web page context , but also from a collective analysis of all the pages corresponding to an entity , and from constraints related to the actual values within the domain .

There is one ILP per entity and it is small enough to be solved in under 38 milliseconds in our experiments .

Prior research in this domain has used inappropriate statistical methodology to model distributions and current industrial practice eschews this research for conservative ad-hoc click-level thresholds .

Nowadays , the increasing amount of semantic data available on the Web leads to a new stage in the potential of Semantic Web applications . However , it also introduces new issues due to the heterogeneity of the available semantic resources . One of the most remarkable is redundancy , that is , the excess of different semantic descriptions , coming from different sources , to describe the same intended meaning . In this paper , we propose a technique to perform a large scale integration of senses ( expressed as ontology terms ) , in order to cluster the most similar ones , when indexing large amounts of online semantic information . It can dramatically reduce the redundancy problem on the current Semantic Web . In order to make this objective feasible , we have studied the adaptability and scalability of our previous work on sense integration , to be translated to the much larger scenario of the Semantic Web . Our evaluation shows a good behavior of these techniques when used in large scale experiments , then making feasible the proposed approach .", "14449751": "A flexible generative model for preference aggregation . Many areas of study , such as information retrieval , collaborative filtering , and social choice face the preference aggregation problem , in which multiple preferences over objects must be combined into a consensus ranking . Preferences over items can be expressed in a variety of forms , which makes the aggregation problem difficult . In this work we formulate a flexible probabilistic model over pairwise comparisons that can accommodate all these forms . Inference in the model is very fast , making it applicable to problems with hundreds of thousands of preferences . Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance to existing methods", "8933907": "Metadata co-development : a process resulting in metadata about technical assistance to educators . Metadata development can be challenging because the vocabulary should be flexible and extensible , widely applicable , interoperable , and both machine and human readable . We describe how we engaged members of organizations in the field of technical assistance to educators in a process of metadata development , and the challenges we faced . The result was a an ontology for the communities of practice that is interoperable and can evolve it was then used to catalogue resources for dissemination via the Semantic Web .", "7511137": "Forcehttps : protecting high-security web sites from network attacks . As wireless networks proliferate , web browsers operate in an increasingly hostile network environment . The HTTPS protocol has the potential to protect web users from network attackers , but real-world deployments must cope with misconfigured servers , causing imperfect web sites and users to compromise browsing sessions inadvertently . ForceHTTPS is a simple browser security mechanism that web sites or users can use to opt in to stricter error processing , improving the security of HTTPS by preventing network attacks that leverage the browser 's lax error processing . By augmenting the browser with a database of custom URL rewrite rules , ForceHTTPS allows sophisticated users to transparently retrofit security onto some insecure sites that support HTTPS . We provide a prototype implementation of ForceHTTPS as a Firefox browser extension .", "8950066": "The semantic webscape : a view of the semantic web . It has been a few years since the semantic Web was initiated by W3C , but its status has not been quantitatively measured . It is crucial to understand the status at this early stage , for researchers , developers and administrators to gain insight into what will come in this field . The objective of our work is to quantitatively measure and present the status of the semantic Web . We conduct a longitudinal study on the semantic Web pages to track trends in the use of semantic markup languages . This paper presents early results of this study with two historical data sets from October 2003 and October 2004 . Our results show that while it is very early stage of semantic Web adoption , its growth outpaces that of the entire Web for the period . Also , RDF ( Resource Description Framework ) has dominated among semantic markup languages , taking about 98 % of all semantic pages on the Web . It has been used in a variety of metadata annotation applications . This study shows that the most popular application is RSS ( RDF Site Summary ) for syndicating news and blogs , which takes more than 60 % of all semantic Web pages . It also shows that the use of OWL ( Web Ontology Language ) which was recommended by W3C in early 2004 has been increased 900 % for the period .", "4059165": "Estimating required recall for successful knowledge acquisition from the web . Information on the Web is not only abundant but also redundant . This redundancy of information has an important consequence on the relation between the recall of an information gathering system and its capacity to harvest the core information of a certain domain of knowledge .

Despite the success of web search engines , search over large enterprise intranets still suffers from poor result quality . Earlier work ( 6 ) that compared intranets and the Internet from the view point of keyword search has pointed to several reasons why the search problem is quite different in these two domains . In this paper , we address the problem of providing high quality answers to navigational queries in the intranet ( e.g. , queries intended to find product or personal home pages , service pages , etc. ) . Our approach is based on offline identification of navigational pages , intelligent generation of term-variants to associate with each page , and the construction of separate indices exclusively devoted to answering navigational queries . Using a testbed of 5.5 M pages from the IBM intranet , we present evaluation results that demonstrate that for navigational queries , our approach of using custom indices produces results of significantly higher precision than those produced by a general purpose search algorithm .", "4654892": "Automatic extraction of web search interfaces for interface schema integration .

This paper addresses the problem of fast retrieval of data from XML documents by providing a labeling schema that can easily handle simple as well as complex XPATH queries and also provide for updates without the need for the entire document being re-indexed in the RDBMS . We introduce a new labeling schema called the `` Z-Label '' for efficiently processing XPATH queries involving child and descendant axes . The use of `` Z-Label '' coupled with the indexing schema provides for smooth updates in the XML document .", "9063415": "Test case prioritization for regression testing of service-oriented business applications . Regression testing assures the quality of modified service-oriented business applications against unintended changes . However , a typical regression test suite is large in size . Earlier execution of those test cases that may detect failures is attractive . Many existing prioritization techniques order test cases according to their respective coverage of program statements in a previous version of the application . On the other hand , industrial service-oriented business applications are typically written in orchestration languages such as WS-BPEL and integrated with workflow steps and web services via XPath and WSDL . Faults in these artifacts may cause the application to extract wrong data from messages , leading to failures in service compositions . Surprisingly , current regression testing research hardly considers these artifacts . We propose a multilevel coverage model to capture the business process , XPath , and WSDL from the perspective of regression testing . We develop a family of test case prioritization techniques atop the model . Empirical results show that our techniques can achieve significantly higher rates of fault detection than existing techniques .", "13064296": "Information spreading in context . Information spreading processes are central to human interactions . Despite recent studies in online domains , little is known about factors that could affect the dissemination of a single piece of information . In this paper , we address this challenge by combining two related but distinct datasets , collected from a large scale privacy-preserving distributed social sensor system . We find that the social and organizational context significantly impacts to whom and how fast people forward information . Yet the structures within spreading processes can be well captured by a simple stochastic branching model , indicating surprising independence of context . Our results build the foundation of future predictive models of information flow and provide significant insights towards design of communication platforms .", "1182832": "How semantics make better wikis . Wikis are popular collaborative hypertext authoring environments , but they neither support structured access nor information reuse . Adding semantic annotations helps to address these limitations .

This paper presents the design and user evaluation of SmartBack , a feature that complements the standard Back button by enabling users to jump directly to key pages in their navigation session , making common navigation activities more efficient . Defining key pages was informed by the findings of a user study that involved detailed monitoring of Web usage and analysis of Web browsing in terms of navigation trails . The pages accessible through SmartBack are determined automatically based on the structure of the user 's navigation trails or page association with specific user 's activities , such as search or browsing bookmarked sites . We discuss implementation decisions and present results of a usability study in which we deployed the SmartBack prototype and monitored usage for a month in both corporate and home settings . The results show that the feature brings qualitative improvement to the browsing experience of individuals who use it ."}
